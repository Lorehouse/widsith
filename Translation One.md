Widsi√∞ spoke, unlocked his wordhoard,
he who most of all people over the earth
traveled among tribes; often in great halls he received
handsome gifts. He came from the people
of the Myrgings. He with Ealhhilde, <5>
the fair peace-weaver, first traveled
seeking the home of the king of the Ostrogoths,
Ermanric, east of the Angle's land,
hostile oathbreaker. He began then to speak a great many words:

"I have learned by asking many men who rule tribes! <10>
Men shall each live in good custom,
a leader after others, governing their homeland,
whoever desires his throne to prosper.

There was Hwala, for a while the best,
and Alexander (the Great) most powerful <15>
of all mankind, and he most throve
Of those whom I have heard of over the earth.

Atilla ruled the Huns, Ermanric the Goths,
Becca the Banings, Gifica the Burgundians.

Caesar ruled the Greeks and Caelic the Finns, <20>
Hagena the Rugians, and Heoden the Glomman.

Witta ruled the Swaefe, Wada Haelsings,
Meaca Myrgings, Mearchealf the Hundings (same as the Langobards).

Theodric ruled the Franks, Thyle the Rondings,
Breoca the Brondings, Billing the Werns. <25>

Oswin ruled the Eows and Fin the Jutes,
Fin Folkwalding the Frisian tribes.

Sighere ruled the Sea-Danes the longest,
Hnaef the Hocings, Helm the Wulfings,
Wald the Woings, Wod the Thuringians, <30>
Saeferth the Sycgans, Ongendtheow the Swedes,
Sceafthere the Ymbran, Sheaf the Langobards,
Hunn the Haetwere, and Holen the Wrosnan.

Hringwald was called the Herefaren's king.

Offa ruled the Angel, Alewih the Danes: <35>
He was of those men the noblest,
however he did not achieve more valorous deeds than Offa,
but Offa won first of men, 
while a youth, the greatest kingdom.
Not any of his contemporaries were greater in valorous deeds <40>
at fighting. With his one sword 
he defined the boundary against the Myrgings
by Fifeldore (the Eider estuary, held afterwards
by the Angels and the Suebi as he'd won it.

Hrothwulf and Hrothgar held longest <45> 
kinship together, uncle and sister's son,
after they drove off the Viking trible
and humbled Ingeld's vanguard,
and at Heorot cut to pieces the force of the Heathobards.

As I traversed many foreign lands <50>
throughout a wide region, good and evil
I experienced there, deprived of my people,
far from generous kinsmen, and served far and wide. 
Therefore I will sing and speak a tale, 
Making known before the company in the mead-hall <55>
how the well-born would be generous with choice gifts to me.
I was with the Huns and with the Ostrogoths,
with the Swedes and with the Geats and with the South-Danes.

With the Wenlas I was, and with the Varn, and with the Vikings.
With the Gibids I was and with the Winedas and with the Gefflegans. <60>
With the Angles I was and with the Swaefe and with the Aenenas.
With the Saxons I was and the Sycgans and with the Suardones.
With the Hronan I was and the Deans and with the Heathoramas.
With the Thuringians I was and with the Throwend 
and with the Burgundians; There I received a necklace; <65>
there Guthhere gave a goodly treasure 
to reward songs; that king was not stingy!

With the Franks I was and with the Frisians and with the Framtings.
With the Rugians I was and with the Glomman and with the Rome-foreigners.
Likewise I was in Italy with Aelfwine <70>
who had of all mankind whom I have learned 
the quickest hand to earning praise, 
a generous heart distributing rings
bright treasures, that son of Edwin!

With the Sercings I was and with the Serae. <75>
With the Greeks I was and with the Finns and with Caesar,
he who ruled over many towns of revelry, 
possessed riches and treasures and the realm of the Romans.

With the Irish I was and with the Picts and with the Lapps.
With the Lidwiccas I was and with the Leonas and with the Langobards, <80>
With heathens and with heroes and with the Hundings (could heathens and heroes be puns?).
with the Israelites I was and with the Assyrians, 
with the Hebrews and with the Indus and with the Egyptians.
WIth the Moids I was and with the Perse, and with the Myrgings
and the Mofdings and the Ongendmyrgings <85>
and with the Amothings. With the east Thuringians I was
and with the Ilwan and with the Austrogoths and Idumings. 

And I was with Ermanric all the time,
There the king of the Goths was good and generous to me,
first among the townspeople, gave me a ring <90>
in which of refined gold, the count of 
six hundred shillings were reckoned,
Which I gave into the possession of Eadgils,
my lord protector, when I came home,
to my beloved lord because it was he who gave me land, <95>
the king of the Myrgings, my father's inheritance.
And then to me Ealhhild gave a second ring, 
the queen of the army fighting men, the daughter of Edwin. 
Her praise stretched throughout many lands
when I in song must say <100>
where under the sky I best knew
the gold-adorned queen distributing gifts.
Then with Scilling our clear voices
we raised before our victory lord
loudly with harp, singing loud to the harp <105>
then many men of proud spirits
who had good knowledge spoke words
that they had never heard a better song.
Thence I traversed all the land of the Ostrogoths, 
I sought the best battle comrades <110>
that was ever the household of Ermanric.
Hache I sought and Beadecan and the Herelingas
Emerca I sought and Fridla and the East-goths,
wise and good, father of Unwen
Seccan I sought and Beccan, Seafola and Theodric <115>
Heathoric and Sifecta, Lotherus and Incgentheow.
Edwin I sought and Elsa, Agelmund and Hungar,
and the proud company of the Withmyrgings.
Wulfhere I sought and Wyrmhere, very often warfare was not at rest
when the Hraede army with hard swords <120>
around the Wistle wood must defend
the ancestral lands of Attila's people.
Raedhere I sought and Rondhere, Rumstan and Gislaharius,
Withergield and Freotheric, Wudga and Hama
there were not the worst comrades in arms <125>
Though I mention them at the last.
Very often from that company flew the whining
and shrieking spear against a hostile people.
Wanderers there ruled with wound gold
over men and women, Wudga and Hama. <130>
Thus I have always found it in journeying
that they be dearest to their subjects
whom God has given the right to rule men
for holding while he lives here.
Thus are fated to wandering and roving <135>
are the minstrel men throughout many regions,
saying at need, speaking thank-words,
always meeting someone south or north
appreciative of poems with generous gifts for those
who before military men will will heighten their reputation <140>
to do valorous deeds until everything passes,
light and life together. He who works for praise 
has under the heavens lasting glory.
