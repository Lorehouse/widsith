Eormanrīc	Ermanric	Eormanrīces,	8	gsn	Ostrogothic king in the late middle 4th century, see his contemporary historian, Ammanius Marcellinus, as well as Jordanes. Ammanius tells that his great empire was so threatened by Huns and Alans that he committed suicide, though Jordanes leaves this out (Malone 146). Son of Amelunc and uncle of Dietrich von Berne (Þeodric), <i>Dietrichs Flucht</i> paints him very badly, as do other Old German heroic tales (Gillespie 37, 38). Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149).

hæleþ	heroes	hæleþum	81	dpn	WOW this is interesting. I had interpreted this on my read-through as 'heroes' but Malone and some other writers identify this with the inhabitants ot the Hala heret in <i>Jordebog</i> of King Valdemar II of Denmark. Lappenberg 1838 and Grein read it as <i>Hæreþum</i>, identifying the tribe with the Charudes of classical antiquity (all in Malone 157). Mackie and Dobbie keep the MS reading and take it as the dpn 'hæleþ' or hero, which I am adopting for the time being. I will copy this note into my log.
Hælsingas	Hælsings	Hælsingum,	22	ipn	An unknown tribe who etymology may be connected to the Chalusos river mapped by Ptolemy. Malone goes on to associate them with the Hæleþan of line 81 (Malone 158).

Heðca	Hache	Heðcan	112	asn	Malone corrects this to Hehca, and associates him with 'Hache', a Germanic hero (Malone 168). Anscombe 1916 amends it to Hæþcan and identifies the character with King Hæðcyn of Beowulf.

(Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.

Ongendmyrgingas	the Ongendmyrgings	Ongendmyrgingum	85	dpn	Malone has this combined with the previous word to form the Ongendmyrgingum but neither Chambers nor the ASPR does this. If it were correct, it might be identical to the later Wiþmyrgingas in 116. Malone takes his cue from Rieger and Langenfelt in following the structure of 'Ongendþeow' and placing the Ongend as a prefix of the word. Because of the presence of the 'regular' Myrgings in this same stanza, I have opted for Malone's reading.
Ongendþeow	Ongenþeow	Ongendþeow,	31	nsn	A king of the Swedes mentioned in Beowulf (as Ongenþoew), his name becongs Angantyr in Old Norse. The Ongend- element means sting or prick and Malone then extrapolates to 'phallus', associating Ongend- with a priest of a fertility cult, perhaps Yngvi Freyr.

Rondingas	The Rondings	Rondingum,	24	dpn	The men of Telemark, famously weird skiers with whom no self-respecting Alpine skier would associate. The name means 'borderers' and seems to be a poetic appelation based on their region being called a <i>mark</i> or borderland. (Malone 191-192)

Rumstan	Rumstan	Rumstan	123	asn	 often connected with the Germanic hero Rimstien, but Widsith seems to associate him with Gislhere of the Burgundians and the German hero is a Goth. Malone (192) supposes the hero was forgotten and then his name reborrowed as the Gothic legend cycle grew.
