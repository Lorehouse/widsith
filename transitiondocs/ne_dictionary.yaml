Ægelmund: "first king of the Langobards"
Ælfwine: "King Alboin of the Langobards, called Elvewine in König Rother(Gillespie 36)"
Ænēnas: "Anenas, an unidentified tribe, potentially Aunonia of Kossinna argued by Malone pg 127"
Ætla: "the Hun."
Alewih: "unknown Danish king"
Alexandreas: "proper name, Alexander the great"
Amoþingas: "Inhabitants of the island of Hindø in Norway, which appears in cap. 29 of the <i>Ynglingasaga</i> by Snorri"
Baningas: "Malone has a long note here connecting Baningum with Bainaib (Cuntz 1923) and Ptolemy's Βαινοχαιμαι, whom he argues are separate from the Bohemians (Boihœmum, Marquart)"
Becca: "from OE Beocca, possibly identified with Bikki from <i>Snorra Edda<i> and <i>Völsungasaga</i>, Ermanric's treacherous retainer, and Bicco in Saxo's <i>Gesta Danorum</i> but Malone dismisses this as linguistically improbable (pg 131)."
Becca: "Berchtung of the Wolfdietrich story, occaisionally also indentified with the evil Bikki but this Becca is clearly in the wrong company to be associated wtih that story"
Billing: "Malone 132-133) According to Chambers and Redin the name is derived from a kind of sword called a <i>bill</i>"
Breoca: "The Breca of <i>Beowulf</i> fame, the great swimmer, though his name likely refers to being a great breaker of rings or breaker of shield walls. (Malone 133)"
Brondingas: "an unknown tribe, though Malone has some great speculation here (133-134)"
Burgendan: "a Germanic tribe dwelling in the Rhine region and later the Rhone."
Casere: "The Byzantine Roman emperor in Constantinople"
Casere: "Malone argues on pg 135 for an Eastern Roman emperor here, possibly Justinian"
Dēan: "unknown tribe in the southern Scandinavian peninsula, the Daukiones of Ptolemy (ii.11.16, Malone 135)"
Eadgils: "King of the Myrgings, otherwise unknown. Malone has LOTS to say on pgs 137-139"
Eadwine: "King of the Langobards, Audoin"
Eadwine: "The father of Ealhhild but the timeline doesn't work for him to then also be Audoin, the Langobardish ging (Malone 140)"
Eadwine: "### Audoin, again"
Ealhhild: "Eadwine's daughter"
Ealhhilde: "Ermanric's wife, daughter of the Eadwine of line 98. Whether she was a Langobard is debated, Guest 1838 calling her father the 'lord of the Myrgings'. Malone connects her wtih the Scandinavian Swanhild of legend (140), though there is none of the enmity between Ealhhild and her husband that there is between Swanhild and hers."
Eastgota: "Early king of the Ostrogoths, contemporary of Roman Emperor Philip (244-9) (Malone 142)"
Eastþyringas: "### Still the best sausages in Germany"
Elsa: "based on context, ought to be a Langobardish hero, but otherwise unknown"
Emerca: "Emerca is the Gothic hero Erpamara, found in Jordanes 43"
Eormanrīc: "Ostrogothic king in the late middle 4th century, see his contemporary historian, Ammanius Marcellinus, as well as Jordanes. Ammanius tells that his great empire was so threatened by Huns and Alans that he committed suicide, though Jordanes leaves this out (Malone 146). Son of Amelunc and uncle of Dietrich von Berne (Þeodric), <i>Dietrichs Flucht</i> paints him very badly, as do other Old German heroic tales (Gillespie 37, 38). Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149)."
Eowan: "A tribe Conybeare associates with the Baltic island of Öland"
Fin: "King of rhe Frisians and the Finn from Beowulf and the <i>Finnsburuh Fragment</i>"
Folcwalding: "The patronymic of Finn's father, but Chambers suggests that it was a title that alliterated conveniently rather than Finn's father's real name (1921, 200)"
Freoþerīc: "unidentified king or hero, sometimes conneced with the Heathobards and other times with Rederic, King of the Rugians, but Malone mentions there is no evidence for this (150)."
Fridla: "Gothic king Fridigernus"
Frumtingas: "The people of King Framta, a faction of the Suevi in Spain. See <i>Historia Svevorum</i>(Malone 152)"
Gēatas: "The Geats are common knowledge"
Gefflēgan: "The Aviones of Tacitus but location unknown"
Gefwulf: "King of the Jutes (Ytum), but otherwise unknown"
Gefþan: "A tribe of the Gothic family mentioned in Beowulf @@@ Better notes."
Gifica: "Also the Gibica mentioned in King Gundobad's <i>Leges Burgudionum</i> (see Malone 154), believed by F. Bluhme to be the father of Gundomar, Gislahari (Gislhere, line 123) and Gundahari(Guðhere, line 66). Malone speculates that these may represent each a generation."
Gislhere: "King of the Burgundians, who Malone speculates would have been an ancestor of the more famous Guðhere"
Glomman: "A tribe perhaps the same as Tacitus's Lemovii on the Oder estuary."
Guðhere: "King of the Burgundians, Gunter/Gunther of OHG, who was defeated by the Huns in the Nibelungenlied, Þiðrikssaga, and the Volsungasaga."
hæleþ: "WOW this is interesting. I had interpreted this on my read-through as 'heroes' but Malone and some other writers identify this with the inhabitants ot the Hala heret in <i>Jordebog</i> of King Valdemar II of Denmark. Lappenberg 1838 and Grein read it as <i>Hæreþum</i>, identifying the tribe with the Charudes of classical antiquity (all in Malone 157). Mackie and Dobbie keep the MS reading and take it as the dpn 'hæleþ' or hero, which I am adopting for the time being. I will copy this note into my log."
Hælsingas: "An unknown tribe who etymology may be connected to the Chalusos river mapped by Ptolemy. Malone goes on to associate them with the Hæleþan of line 81 (Malone 158)."
hæþen: "Various editors believe this to be the word 'heathen' as below is the word 'hero', but Malone argues in the spirit of Lappenberg 1838, that these are the inhabitants of the Norwegian region called Hedemark (Malone 159). I am currently adopting the 'heathens and heroes' reading but am open to changing my mind."
Hagena: "a king of the Rugians, famous from the Hild Saga, also the foe of Heoden below"
Hama: "The Heime of German lore, an exile who has carved out a kingdom for himself and is paired in this poem with Wudga. Malone states that the poet clearly thought of them as joint rulers of a single kingdom, though Chambers argues they were outlaws a la Robin Hood (pg 159-160). This is the Hama of Beowulf who carried off the bright necklace of the Brosings."
Heaðobeardan: "These are the Heathobards of Beowulf. Malone presumes that they were closely related to the Langobards."
Heaþoric: "Malone  states that this is the Heiðrekr of the <i>Harvararsaga</i>, and while the phonology does not precisely align, the three remaining names in this line are all from <i>Hervararsaga</i>. He also draws a connection between this Heaþoric and the Hæðcyn of <i>Beowulf</i>."
Heðca: "Malone corrects this to Hehca, and associates him with 'Hache', a Germanic hero (Malone 168). Anscombe 1916 amends it to Hæþcan and identifies the character with King Hæðcyn of Beowulf."
Helm: "Helm, King of the Wulfings"
Heoden: "The ASPR XML has this word tagged as 'unclear' and boy howdy is it ever. The OEPIF project shows it as very unclear as well. Malone reads it as Henden but says it is the character Heoden of the Hild saga (pg 168). Chambers and ASPR both record it as 'Heoden', so that is what I'm going to stick with for now."
Heorot: "Heorot of Hroðgar in <i>Beowulf</i>."
Herelingas: "The followers of Herela, or King Herla of Water Map, the leader of the Wild Host (or Woden in disguise), but the poet here is likely referring to the Harlun brothers (Malone 170)."
Hlīþe: "Hlǫðr of the HErvararsaga, Lotherus of Saxo Grammaticus, a mythical Gothic or Geatish king, though in the past he was identified with King Leth of the Langobards (Grienberger 1922, 377)"
Hnæf: "King of the Hocingas, appears in both Beowulf and the <i>Finnsburuh Fragment</i>"
Hocingas: "The Hocings are clarified as Danes in <i>Beowulf</i> (1090, 1158), Here-Scyldings (1069, 1108, 1154), and Healfdenes (1069). Malone has notes on them on pgs 172-173."
Holen: "Malone takes Holen to mean 'protector' in l 80 of the Exeter Book Gnomic Verses. Others associate it with OE <i>holegn</i> meaning 'holly'. (Malone 173)"
Holmrygas: "All editions note that the 'g' is missing from the manuscript and they add it back in. Malone, in his glossary, makes the additional correction of a 'c', rendering this <i>holmrycgas</i>, <i>holmrycgum</i>. Malone identifies the Rugians as the Hulmerugi of Jordanes, in the islands of the estuary of the Vistula. (174)"
Hræde: "###"
Hreðcyning: "refers to Ermanric, named in the next line"
Hringwald: "means Ring-Ruler, great name"

Incgenþeow: "Angantyr of the Hervararsaga and the historical King Ongenþeow of Sweden, who appears in Beowulf."
Indeas: "Inhabitants of India"
Ingeld: "king of the Heathobards and son of Froda"
Iste: "A specific tribe of the Ostrogoths"
Lidwicingas: "Malone emends this to Lidingum and associates them with the Liðungar of Islenzkir Analar, but others associate it as is with the Lidwiccas in the <i>OE Annals</i>. I have chosen to leave it unchanged for the moment"
Meaca: " Unknown king of the Myrgings"
Mearchealf: "unknowng king of the Hundings, but his name may be derived from <i>mearh</i> 'horse' and <i>ealf</i> 'elf'."
Mofdingas: "Malone changes this to the 'Ofdingas' for complex reasons. Nobody else does this, so I have elected to leave it, though he makes a compelling argument (pg2 186-187)."
Moide: "Malone 183: Moide are the inhabitates of Møn in the Danish archipelago, and a well known harbor and battle-site. Earlier editors associated the Moide with the Medes but this spelling would be a one-off then, as the Medes are usuall spelled Meðas or Mœðe."
Myrgingas: "the tribe to which Widsið belonged. 'By virtue of the Offa episode, the Myrgings can be localized with some precision; they lived south of the river Eider, in a region apparently identical with that held by the Saxons of Ptolemy and certainly identical with that held by the Nordalbings of later times, themselves a branch of the Old Saxons (to use King Alfred's term).' (Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna."
nsn: "A king of the Swedes mentioned in Beowulf (as Ongenþoew), his name becongs Angantyr in Old Norse. The Ongend- element means sting or prick and Malone then extrapolates to 'phallus', associating Ongend- with a priest of a fertility cult, perhaps Yngvi Freyr."
Offa: "King of Ongel also in Beowulf, and as Uffa in Saxo Grammaticus and Sweyn Aageson. Latter half of the 4th century and king of the Angles."
Ongel: "The original homeland of the Angles before Britain, and probably covered most of Sleswick,"
Ongendmyrgingas: "Malone has this combined with the previous word to form the Ongendmyrgingum but neither Chambers nor the ASPR does this. If it were correct, it might be identical to the later Wiþmyrgingas in 116. Malone takes his cue from Rieger and Langenfelt in following the structure of 'Ongendþeow' and placing the Ongend as a prefix of the word. Because of the presence of the 'regular' Myrgings in this same stanza, I have opted for Malone's reading."
Oswine: "Otherwise unknown"
Peohtas: "###"
Perse: "because of the exotic peoples listed in the previous sentence, these often get translated to the Medes and the Persians; however, Malone points out that in this couplet, they are actually paired with Scandinavian and Germanic tribes. Because of this, the identity of the Perse is unknown."
Rædhere: "an unknown king or hero, whose name means 'command (or counsel) the army'."
Rondhere: "unknown hero whose name means shield-army, or less literally, 'protector'."
Rondingas: "The men of Telemark, famously weird skiers with whom no self-respecting Alpine skier would associate. The name means 'borderers' and seems to be a poetic appelation based on their region being called a <i>mark</i> or borderland. (Malone 191-192)"
Rugas: "### Who are the Rugis??"
Rumstan: " often connected with the Germanic hero Rimstien, but Widsith seems to associate him with Gislhere of the Burgundians and the German hero is a Goth. Malone (192) supposes the hero was forgotten and then his name reborrowed as the Gothic legend cycle grew."
Rumwalas: "Malone (193) identifies the Rumwalas as the eastern Roman empire, which is heavily disputed by other authors ### Check Weiskott"
Sæferð: "King of the Sycgan, some debate that he is the Sigeferþ of Beowulf and Holthausen translates the name Seefried. We cannot be certain of his identity."
Sceafa: "A king of the Langobards but Price 1826 identified him as the mythical 'Scef', father of the equally mythical 'Scyld Scefing'. Malone rejects this association because Scyld was, of course, mythical."
Sceafthere: "unknown king but his name means 'spear-army (compare with Rondhere, 'shield-army)."
Scilling: "A scop who sang with Widsith on at least one occasion, Malone compares this to rune-singers in Finnish tradition (194)."
Scottas: "Not the Scots"
Scridefinnas: "The Lapps of arctic Norway, Scride- (skis) exists to differentiate them from the Finns proper."
Seafola: "A legendary traitorous retainer from the Wolfdietrich tale, according to Malone 194-195. Chambers instead has this as Sabene of Rabene in the Dietrich von Berne story (see Gillespie 28)."
Seaxan: "The original Saxons of Germany"
Secca: "The young Sigiwald of history, kinsmen of the Frankish Þeodric. His story is found in Gregory of Tours' <i>Historia Fancorum iii</i> (Malone 196)."
Sercingas: "Perhaps Tacitus's Siraci, a Black Sea tribe, or perhaps the Serica of the ancients (Sedgefield 1922, 136), though Malone notes this would then connect them with the Serkland and Serkir in the same line (197)."
Seringas: "The Serae of the ancients,"
Sifeca: "An evil counselor of unknown origin but with lots of speculation (Malone 199)."
Sigehere: "King of the Sea-Danes, the Sigarr of the <i>Snorra Edda</i>"
Swæfe: "The Eider-Suebi, a branch of the Suebi that settled in western Sleswick. Malone mentions that with their close association with the Angles as well as Bede's mention of their ruler Witta being the grandfather of Hengest, it is not unreasonable ot infer that they took part in the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britannia (201)."
Sweon: "The Swedes of Uppland"
Sweordwere: "From Tacitus, as Malone so adeptly argues in 202-203."
Sycgan: "Only otherwise known from the Finnsburug Fragment, l24, where they are the Secgena(gpn)."
Unwen: "Son of Eastgota l 113, meaning 'unexpected one'"
Wada: "King of the Hælsings, in this poem not the father of mythical Weland or grandfather of Wudga. (Malone 206-207)"
Wærne: "The Varni of Procopius and the Varini of Tacitus, and perhaps the Varinnae of Pliny. Procopius puts this tribe east of the Rhine, in the region controlled by the Saxons. Tacitus puts them in Jutland."
Walas: "A generic word meaning 'foreigners' but usually referring to Romans. This name was later to be come the appelation given to the land of 'Wales' or of 'foreigners'"
Wald: "King of the Woings, otherwise unknown"
Wenlas: "The Wendlas of Beowulf 348, though whether he was Wendlas of the Vandili of Pliny, or of the Winnili (the Langobards), or still further a dweller of the Vendel of northern Jutland (called the Wandali by Saxo Grammaticus), is unknown for certain. (Malone 209)"
Wicingas: "This is a reference to the Heaðobeards, according to Malone, but often translated as Vikings."
Widsið: "the fictitious scop celebrated in this poem"
Winedas: "The Wends, a generic German name for the Slavs."
Wistlawudu: "The forest of the Vistula goths"
Witta: "King of the Swæfe, and according to Bede, grandfather to Hengest and Horsa."
Wiþergield: "The Wiðergyld of Beowulf 2051, a Heathobeard."
Wiþmyrgingas: "### need to check Chambers 123, 215, 221, but Malone (211) has these as the Myrgings who dwell in the valley of the With (Vid) river, and perhaps identical to the Ongendmyrgings."
Wod: "King of the Þyringas, otherwise unknown"
Woingas: "A tribe otherwise unknown"
Wrosnan: "A Danish island tribe"
Wudga: "THe hero Widia from <i>Waldere</i> and the Viðga of <i>Þiðrrikssaga</i>"

Wyrmhere: "The Ormarr of the <i>Hervararsaga</i>, also the Olimarus of Saxo's 5th book. One of two princes of the Hræde who let their people in a war against the Huns (Malone 214)."
Yte: "The Euts or Jutes, one of the three tribes Bede names as taking part in the English conquest of Britain (Malone 215)."
Yumbran: "An unknown tribe"
þeodric: "This Theodric is not the same as the one above according to Chambers (See Malone 204). Chambers associates this Theodric as Dietrich von Bern, which would make Seafola above Sabene von Rabene. Malone considers this impossible based on Jiriczek's paper (1920 in <i>Englische Studien</i>) in which Seafola is identified as the Wolfdietrich villain."
Þeodric: "Malone has him as the oldest son of Clovis and king of the Franks, and says that this Theodric is the same Theodric as in l. 115. Chambers and other dispute this. This Theodric is, indeed, Hugdietrich, king of the Franks (as stated in the poem), but l.115 would then be Dietrich of Bern."
Þrowend: "The inhabitants of Norway's Trøndelagen, the Þrøndr (Malone 205)."
Þyle: "King of the Rondings. Malone explains the name as the eponym of the Þilir, a tribe in the Telemark, giving identification to the Rondings below."
Þyringas: "Either the Thoringi of Gregory of Tours or the Tungri (Thuringians) of inland Germany. It is not impossible that these are actually the same tribe. (Malone 206)"
