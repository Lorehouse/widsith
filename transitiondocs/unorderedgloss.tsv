Myrgingas	the Myrgings	Myrgingum	4	dpn	the tribe to which Widsið belonged. 'By virtue of the Offa episode, the Myrgings can be localized with some precision; they lived south of the river Eider, in a region apparently identical with that held by the Saxons of Ptolemy and certainly identical with that held by the Nordalbings of later times, themselves a branch of the Old Saxons (to use King Alfred's term).' (Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.

Ealhhilde	Ealhhilde	Ealhhilde,	5	dsn	Ermanric's wife, daughter of the Eadwine of line 98. Whether she was a Langobard is debated, Guest 1838 calling her father the 'lord of the Myrgings'. Malone connects her wtih the Scandinavian Swanhild of legend (140), though there is none of the enmity between Ealhhild and her husband that there is between Swanhild and hers.

Ongel	the Angles land	Ongle,	8	dpn	The original homeland of the Angles before Britain, and probably covered most of Sleswick,
Eormanrīc	Ermanric	Eormanrīces,	8	gsn	Ostrogothic king in the late middle 4th century, see his contemporary historian, Ammanius Marcellinus, as well as Jordanes. Ammanius tells that his great empire was so threatened by Huns and Alans that he committed suicide, though Jordanes leaves this out (Malone 146). Son of Amelunc and uncle of Dietrich von Berne (Þeodric), <i>Dietrichs Flucht</i> paints him very badly, as do other Old German heroic tales (Gillespie 37, 38). Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149). <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermanaric'>Wikipedia</a>

Eormanrīc	Ermanric	Eormanric	18	nsn	None
Gotan	the Goths	Gotum,	18	ipn	Malone views these as the Ostrogoths, but this is disputed and he may have ruled a broad range of the Gothic peoples. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths'>Wikipedia</a>
Becca	Becca	Becca	19	nsn	from OE Beocca, possibly identified with Bikki from <i>Snorra Edda</i> and <i>Völsungasaga</i>, Ermanric's treacherous retainer, and Bicco in Saxo's <i>Gesta Danorum</i> but Malone dismisses this as linguistically improbable (pg 131).
Baningas	the Baningas	Baningum,	19	dpn	Malone has a long note here connecting Baningum with Bainaib (Cuntz 1923) and Ptolemy's Βαινοχαιμαι, whom he argues are separate from the Bohemians (Boihœmum, Marquart)
Burgendan	the Burgundians	Burgendum	19	dpn	a Germanic tribe dwelling in the Rhine region and later the Rhone. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundians'>Wikipedia</a>
Gifica	Gifica	Gifica.	19	nsn	Also the Gibica mentioned in King Gundobad's <i>Leges Burgudionum</i> (see Malone 154), believed by F. Bluhme to be the father of Gundomar, Gislahari (Gislhere, line 123) and Gundahari(Guðhere, line 66). Malone speculates that these may represent each a generation.
Casere	Caesar	Casere	20	nsn	The Byzantine Roman emperor in Constantinople

Creacas	the Greeks	Creacum	20	dpn	The Roman emperor now ruled the Greeks predominantly.
ond	and	ond	20	conj	None
Cælic	Caelic	Cælic	20	nsn	There is considerable debate about this name, with Grienberger 1922 arguing that it is a nickname meaning 'cup', but it is more commonly considered to be related to the term 'Kalevala'.
Finnas	the Finns	Finnum,	20	dpn	There is some fascinating argument about these peoples. While at first it seems obvious that these are the Finns of Finland (and this is the widely accept view), arguments have been made that these are the Lapps, or even the Irish. Malone points out that the Finns are mentioned again in line 76 and distinguished from the Scridefinns a few lines later who are definitely the Lapps, as well as from the 'Scottum' (who are the Irish) and that means these Finns are the Finns proper.
Hagena	Hagen	Hagena	21	nsn	a king of the Rugians, famous from the Hild Saga, also the foe of Heoden below
Holmrygas	the Rugians	Holmrygum	21	dpn	All editions note that the 'g' is missing from the manuscript and they add it back in. Malone, in his glossary, makes the additional correction of a 'c', rendering this <i>holmrycgas</i>, <i>holmrycgum</i>. Malone identifies the Rugians as the Hulmerugi of Jordanes, in the islands of the estuary of the Vistula. (174)
ond	and	ond	21	conj	None
Heoden	Heoden	Heoden	21	nsn	The ASPR XML has this word tagged as 'unclear' and it truly is. The OEPIF project shows it as very unclear as well. Malone reads it as Henden but says it is the character Heoden of the Hild saga (pg 168). Chambers and ASPR both record it as 'Heoden', so that is what I'm going to stick with for now.
Glomman	the Glomman	Glommum.	21	dpn	None
Witta	Witta	Witta	22	nsn	King of the Swæfe, and according to Bede, grandfather to Hengest and Horsa.
wealdan	ruled	weold	22	psv	None
Swæfe	Swæfe	Swæfum,	22	dpn	The Eider-Suebi, a branch of the Suebi that settled in western Sleswick. Malone mentions that with their close association with the Angles as well as Bede's mention of their ruler Witta being the grandfather of Hengest, it is not unreasonable ot infer that they took part in the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britannia (201).
Wada	Wada	Wada	22	nsn	King of the Hælsings, in this poem not the father of mythical Weland or grandfather of Wudga. (Malone 206-207)
Hælsingas	Hælsings	Hælsingum,	22	ipn	An unknown tribe who etymology may be connected to the Chalusos river mapped by Ptolemy. Malone goes on to associate them with the Hæleþan of line 81 (Malone 158).
Meaca	Meaca	Meaca	23	nsn	 Unknown king of the Myrgings
Myrgingas	the Myrgings	Myrgingum,	23	dpn	None
Mearchealf	Mearchealf	Mearchealf	23	nsn	unknowng king of the Hundings, but his name may be derived from <i>mearh</i> 'horse' and <i>ealf</i> 'elf'.
Hundingas	the Hundings	Hundingum.	23	dpn	nickname for the Langobards
Þeodric	Theodric	Þeodric	24	nsn	Malone has him as the oldest son of Clovis and king of the Franks, and says that this Theodric is the same Theodric as in l. 115. Chambers and other dispute this. This Theodric is, indeed, Hugdietrich, king of the Franks (as stated in the poem), but l.115 would then be Dietrich of Bern.
wealdan	ruled	weold	24	psv	None
Froncan	the Franks	Froncum,	24	dpn	These are the Franks of history, though an earlier name for the tribe seems to have been Hugas, a name that survived in poetry and also as the name 'Hugh'.
Þyle	Thyle	Þyle	24	nsn	King of the Rondings. Malone explains the name as the eponym of the Þilir, a tribe in the Telemark, giving identification to the Rondings below.
Rondingas	The Rondings	Rondingum,	24	dpn	The men of Telemark (tgn, 7003654, http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7003654), famously weird skiers with whom no self-respecting Alpine skier would associate. The name means 'borderers' and seems to be a poetic appelation based on their region being called a <i>mark</i> or borderland. (Malone 191-192)
Breoca	Breoca	Breoca	25	nsn	The Breca of <i>Beowulf</i> fame, the great swimmer, though his name likely refers to being a great breaker of rings or breaker of shield walls. (Malone 133)
Brondingas	Brondings	Brondingum,	25	dpn	an unknown tribe, though Malone has some great speculation here (133-134)
Billing	Billing	Billing	25	nsn	Malone (132-133) According to Chambers and Redin the name is derived from a kind of sword called a <i>bill</i>
Wern	the Werns	Wernum.	25	dpn	The Varini of Tacitus and the Varni of Procopius and perhaps the Varinnae of Pliny (Malone 207). Procopius placed then east of the Rhine, Tacitus seems to put them in Jutland. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warini>Wikipedia</a>
Oswine	Oswin	Oswine	26	nsn	Otherwise unknown
wealdan	ruled	weold	26	psv	None
Eowan	the Eows	Eowum	26	dpn	A tribe Conybeare associates with the Baltic island of Öland (tgn, 7009847, http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7009847).
ond	and	ond	26	conj	None
Yte	the Jutes	Ytum	26	dpn	The Euts or Jutes, one of the three tribes Bede names as taking part in the English conquest of Britain (Malone 215).
Gefwulf	Gefwulf	Gefwulf,	26	nsn	King of the Jutes (Ytum), but otherwise unknown
Fin	Fin	Fin	27	nsn	King of the Frisians and the Finn from Beowulf and the <i>Finnsburuh Fragment</i>.
Folcwalding	son of Folcwalda	Folcwalding	27	nsn	The patronymic of Finn's father, but Chambers suggests that it was a title that alliterated conveniently rather than Finn's father's real name (1921, 200)
Frēsan	the Frisian	Fresna	27	asn	These are the Frisians of history. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisians'>Wikipedia</a>

lengan	longest	lengest	28	adv	None
Sæ-dene	the Sea-Danes	Sæ-denum	28	dpn	It is uncertain whether the prefix 'Sæ' means to restrict these to only the Danes of the islands or as an epithet to emphasize the dominance of the Danes on the sea, but either way these are simply the Danes.
wealdan	ruled	weold,	28	psv	None
Hnæf	Hnæf	Hnæf	29	nsn	King of the Hocingas, appears in both Beowulf and the <i>Finnsburuh Fragment</i>
Hocingas	the Hocings	Hocingum,	29	dpn	The Hocings are clarified as Danes in <i>Beowulf</i> (1090, 1158), Here-Scyldings (1069, 1108, 1154), and Healfdenes (1069). Malone has notes on them on pgs 172-173.
Helm	Helm	Helm	29	nsn	Helm, King of the Wulfings
Wulfingas	the Wulfings	Wulfingum,	29	dpn	The Ylfingar of Norse tradition and the Wylfingas of <i>Beowulf</i>. Malone identifies them with the Vulgares of Paulus. (213)
Wald	Wald	Wald	30	nsn	King of the Woings, otherwise unknown
Woingas	the Woings	Woingum,	30	dpn	A tribe otherwise unknown
Wod	Wod	Wod	30	nsn	King of the Þyringas, otherwise unknown
Þyringas	the Thuringians	Þyringum,	30	dpn	Either the Thoringi of Gregory of Tours or the Tungri (Thuringians) of inland Germany. It is not impossible that these are actually the same tribe. (Malone 206)
Sæferð	Sæferð	Sæferð	31	nsn	King of the Sycgan, some debate that he is the Sigeferþ of Beowulf and Holthausen translates the name Seefried. We cannot be certain of his identity.
Sycgan	Sycgan	Sycgum,	31	dpn	Only otherwise known from the Finnsburug Fragment, l24, where they are the Secgena(gpn).
Sweon	Swedes	Sweom	31	dpn	The Swedes of Uppland (tgn, 7009866, http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7009866)
Ongendþeow	Ongenþeow	Ongendþeow,	31	nsn	A king of the Swedes mentioned in Beowulf (as Ongenþoew), his name becongs Angantyr in Old Norse. The Ongend- element means sting or prick and Malone then extrapolates to 'phallus', associating Ongend- with a priest of a fertility cult, perhaps Yngvi Freyr.
Sceafthere	Sceafthere	Sceafthere	32	nsn	unknown king but his name means 'spear-army (compare with Rondhere, 'shield-army).
Ymbran	the Ymbran	Ymbrum,	32	dpn	An unknown tribe
Sceafa	Sheaf	Sceafa	32	nsn	A king of the Langobards but Price 1826 identified him as the mythical 'Scef', father of the equally mythical 'Scyld Scefing'. Malone rejects this association because Scyld was, of course, mythical.
Longbeardan	the Langobards	Longbeardum,	32	dpn	the Langobards of history. Originating in Scandinavia, this tribe migrated south and settled in the region of Lombardy. The name presumably comes from the words meaning 'long beards'. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombards'>Wikipedia</a>
Hun	Hunn	Hun	33	nsn	This is a king of the Hætwere who appears also in an Icelandic thula and as the champion Hunn who fought in the Battle of Bravellir.
Hætwere	the Hætwere	Hætwerum	33	dpn	These are the Hetware of <i>Beowulf</i>.
ond	and	ond	33	conj	None
Holen	Holen	Holen	33	nsn	Malone takes Holen to mean 'protector' in l80 of the Exeter Book Gnomic Verses. Others associate it with OE <i>holegn</i> meaning 'holly'. (Malone 173)

Malone takes his cue from Rieger and Langenfelt in following the structure of 'Ongendþeow' and placing the Ongend as a prefix of the word. Because of the presence of the 'regular' Myrgings in this same stanza, I have opted for Malone's reading.

Heaþoric	Heathoric	Heaþoric	116	asn	Malone  states that this is the Heiðrekr of the <i>Harvararsaga</i>, and while the phonology does not precisely align, the three remaining names in this line are all from <i>Hervararsaga</i>.

This is the Hama of Beowulf who carried off the bright necklace of the Brosings.
