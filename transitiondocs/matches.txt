Match found Widsið -> the fictitious scop celebrated in this poem
Match found Myrgingas -> the tribe to which Widsið belonged. 'By virtue of the Offa episode, the Myrgings can be localized with some precision; they lived south of the river Eider, in a region apparently identical with that held by the Saxons of Ptolemy and certainly identical with that held by the Nordalbings of later times, themselves a branch of the Old Saxons (to use King Alfred's term).' (Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.
Match found Ealhhilde -> Ermanric's wife, daughter of the Eadwine of line 98. Whether she was a Langobard is debated, Guest 1838 calling her father the 'lord of the Myrgings'. Malone connects her wtih the Scandinavian Swanhild of legend (140), though there is none of the enmity between Ealhhild and her husband that there is between Swanhild and hers.
Match found Eormanrīc -> Ostrogothic king in the late middle 4th century, see his contemporary historian, Ammanius Marcellinus, as well as Jordanes. Ammanius tells that his great empire was so threatened by Huns and Alans that he committed suicide, though Jordanes leaves this out (Malone 146). Son of Amelunc and uncle of Dietrich von Berne (Þeodric), <i>Dietrichs Flucht</i> paints him very badly, as do other Old German heroic tales (Gillespie 37, 38). Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149).
Match found Ongel -> The original homeland of the Angles before Britain, and probably covered most of Sleswick,
Match found Eormanrīc -> Ostrogothic king in the late middle 4th century, see his contemporary historian, Ammanius Marcellinus, as well as Jordanes. Ammanius tells that his great empire was so threatened by Huns and Alans that he committed suicide, though Jordanes leaves this out (Malone 146).

Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149).
Match found Hwala -> Grandson of Sceaf but otherwise unknown
Match found Alexandreas -> proper name, Alexander the great
Match found Ætla -> the Hun.
Match found Hunas -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns

Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149).
Match found Gotan -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths
Match found Becca -> Berchtung of the Wolfdietrich story, occaisionally also indentified with the evil Bikki but this Becca is clearly in the wrong company to be associated wtih that story
Match found Baningas -> Malone has a long note here connecting Baningum with Bainaib (Cuntz 1923) and Ptolemy's Βαινοχαιμαι, whom he argues are separate from the Bohemians (Boihœmum, Marquart)
Match found Burgendan -> a Germanic tribe dwelling in the Rhine region and later the Rhone.
Match found Gifica -> Also the Gibica mentioned in King Gundobad's <i>Leges Burgudionum</i> (see Malone 154), believed by F. Bluhme to be the father of Gundomar, Gislahari (Gislhere, line 123) and Gundahari(Guðhere, line 66). Malone speculates that these may represent each a generation.
Match found Casere -> Malone argues on pg 135 for an Eastern Roman emperor here, possibly Justinian
Match found Creacas -> interesting to note that this is not the Romans any more
Match found Cælic -> @@@
Match found Finnas -> @@@
Match found Hagena -> a king of the Rugians, famous from the Hild Saga, also the foe of Heoden below
Match found Holmrygas -> All editions note that the 'g' is missing from the manuscript and they add it back in. Malone, in his glossary, makes the additional correction of a 'c', rendering this <i>holmrycgas</i>, <i>holmrycgum</i>. Malone identifies the Rugians as the Hulmerugi of Jordanes, in the islands of the estuary of the Vistula. (174)
Match found Heoden -> The ASPR XML has this word tagged as 'unclear' and boy howdy is it ever. The OEPIF project shows it as very unclear as well. Malone reads it as Henden but says it is the character Heoden of the Hild saga (pg 168). Chambers and ASPR both record it as 'Heoden', so that is what I'm going to stick with for now.
Match found Glomman -> A tribe perhaps the same as Tacitus's Lemovii on the Oder estuary.
Match found Witta -> King of the Swæfe, and according to Bede, grandfather to Hengest and Horsa.
Match found Swæfe -> The Eider-Suebi, a branch of the Suebi that settled in western Sleswick. Malone mentions that with their close association with the Angles as well as Bede's mention of their ruler Witta being the grandfather of Hengest, it is not unreasonable ot infer that they took part in the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britannia (201).
Match found Wada -> King of the Hælsings, in this poem not the father of mythical Weland or grandfather of Wudga. (Malone 206-207)
Match found Hælsingas -> An unknown tribe who etymology may be connected to the Chalusos river mapped by Ptolemy. Malone goes on to associate them with the Hæleþan of line 81 (Malone 158).
Match found Meaca ->  Unknown king of the Myrgings
Match found Myrgingas -> the tribe to which Widsið belonged. 'By virtue of the Offa episode, the Myrgings can be localized with some precision; they lived south of the river Eider, in a region apparently identical with that held by the Saxons of Ptolemy and certainly identical with that held by the Nordalbings of later times, themselves a branch of the Old Saxons (to use King Alfred's term).' (Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.
Match found Mearchealf -> unknowng king of the Hundings, but his name may be derived from <i>mearh</i> 'horse' and <i>ealf</i> 'elf'.
Match found Hundingas -> nickname for the Langobards
Match found Þeodric -> Malone has him as the oldest son of Clovis and king of the Franks, and says that this Theodric is the same Theodric as in l. 115. Chambers and other dispute this. This Theodric is, indeed, Hugdietrich, king of the Franks (as stated in the poem), but l.115 would then be Dietrich of Bern.
Match found Froncan -> @@@
Match found Þyle -> King of the Rondings. Malone explains the name as the eponym of the Þilir, a tribe in the Telemark, giving identification to the Rondings below.
Match found Rondingas -> The men of Telemark, famously weird skiers with whom no self-respecting Alpine skier would associate. The name means 'borderers' and seems to be a poetic appelation based on their region being called a <i>mark</i> or borderland. (Malone 191-192)
Match found Breoca -> The Breca of <i>Beowulf</i> fame, the great swimmer, though his name likely refers to being a great breaker of rings or breaker of shield walls. (Malone 133)
Match found Brondingas -> an unknown tribe, though Malone has some great speculation here (133-134)
Match found Billing -> Malone 132-133) According to Chambers and Redin the name is derived from a kind of sword called a <i>bill</i>
Match found Wern -> @@@
Match found Oswine -> Otherwise unknown
Match found Eowan -> A tribe Conybeare associates with the Baltic island of Öland
Match found Yte -> The Euts or Jutes, one of the three tribes Bede names as taking part in the English conquest of Britain (Malone 215).
Match found Gefwulf -> King of the Jutes (Ytum), but otherwise unknown
Match found Fin -> King of rhe Frisians and the Finn from Beowulf and the <i>Finnsburuh Fragment</i>
Match found Folcwalding -> The patronymic of Finn's father, but Chambers suggests that it was a title that alliterated conveniently rather than Finn's father's real name (1921, 200)
Match found Frēsan -> @@@
Match found Sigehere -> King of the Sea-Danes, the Sigarr of the <i>Snorra Edda</i>
Match found Sæ-dene -> @@@
Match found Hnæf -> King of the Hocingas, appears in both Beowulf and the <i>Finnsburuh Fragment</i>
Match found Hocingas -> The Hocings are clarified as Danes in <i>Beowulf</i> (1090, 1158), Here-Scyldings (1069, 1108, 1154), and Healfdenes (1069). Malone has notes on them on pgs 172-173.
Match found Helm -> Helm, King of the Wulfings
Match found Wulfingas -> The Ylfingar of Norse tradition and the Wylfingas of <i>Beowulf</i>. Malone identifies them with the Vulgares of Paulus. (213)
Match found Wald -> King of the Woings, otherwise unknown
Match found Woingas -> A tribe otherwise unknown
Match found Wod -> King of the Þyringas, otherwise unknown
Match found Sæferð -> King of the Sycgan, some debate that he is the Sigeferþ of Beowulf and Holthausen translates the name Seefried. We cannot be certain of his identity.
Match found Sycgan -> Only otherwise known from the Finnsburug Fragment, l24, where they are the Secgena(gpn).
Match found Sweon -> The Swedes of Uppland
Match found Ongendþeow -> A king of the Swedes mentioned in Beowulf (as Ongenþoew), his name becongs Angantyr in Old Norse. The Ongend- element means sting or prick and Malone then extrapolates to 'phallus', associating Ongend- with a priest of a fertility cult, perhaps Yngvi Freyr.
Match found Sceafthere -> unknown king but his name means 'spear-army (compare with Rondhere, 'shield-army).
Match found Ymbran -> An unknown tribe
Match found Sceafa -> A king of the Langobards but Price 1826 identified him as the mythical 'Scef', father of the equally mythical 'Scyld Scefing'. Malone rejects this association because Scyld was, of course, mythical.
Match found Longbeardan -> @@@
Match found Hun -> @@@
Match found Hætwere -> @@@
Match found Holen -> Malone takes Holen to mean 'protector' in l 80 of the Exeter Book Gnomic Verses. Others associate it with OE <i>holegn</i> meaning 'holly'. (Malone 173)
Match found Wrosnan -> A Danish island tribe
Match found Hringwald -> means Ring-Ruler, great name
Match found Herefaran -> @@@
Match found Offa -> @@@
Match found Ongel -> The original homeland of the Angles before Britain, and probably covered most of Sleswick,
Match found Alewih -> unknown Danish king
Match found Dene -> @@@
Match found Offa -> @@@
Match found Offa -> @@@
Match found Myrgingas -> the tribe to which Widsið belonged.

(Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.
Match found Fīfeldore -> the Eider estuary
Match found Ongel -> The original homeland of the Angles before Britain, and probably covered most of Sleswick,
Match found Swæfe -> The Eider-Suebi, a branch of the Suebi that settled in western Sleswick. Malone mentions that with their close association with the Angles as well as Bede's mention of their ruler Witta being the grandfather of Hengest, it is not unreasonable ot infer that they took part in the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britannia (201).
Match found Offa -> @@@
Match found Hroþwulf -> Hroþgar's nephew
Match found Hroðgar -> Our old buddy
Match found Wicingas -> This is a reference to the Heaðobeards, according to Malone, but often translated as Vikings.
Match found Ingeld -> king of the Heathobards and son of Froda
Match found Heorot -> Heorot of Hroðgar in <i>Beowulf</i>.
Match found Heaðobeardan -> These are the Heathobards of Beowulf. Malone presumes that they were closely related to the Langobards.
Match found Hunas -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns
Match found Hreðgotan -> @@@
Match found Sweon -> The Swedes of Uppland
Match found Gēatas -> The Geats are common knowledge
Match found Suþ-dene -> @@@
Match found Wenlas -> The Wendlas of Beowulf 348, though whether he was Wendlas of the Vandili of Pliny, or of the Winnili (the Langobards), or still further a dweller of the Vendel of northern Jutland (called the Wandali by Saxo Grammaticus), is unknown for certain. (Malone 209)
Match found Wærne -> The Varni of Procopius and the Varini of Tacitus, and perhaps the Varinnae of Pliny. Procopius puts this tribe east of the Rhine, in the region controlled by the Saxons. Tacitus puts them in Jutland.
Match found Wicingas -> This is a reference to the Heaðobeards, according to Malone, but often translated as Vikings.
Match found Gefþan -> A tribe of the Gothic family mentioned in Beowulf @@@ Better notes.
Match found Winedas -> The Wends, a generic German name for the Slavs.
Match found Gefflēgan -> The Aviones of Tacitus but location unknown
Match found Ongel -> The original homeland of the Angles before Britain, and probably covered most of Sleswick,
Match found Swæfe -> The Eider-Suebi, a branch of the Suebi that settled in western Sleswick. Malone mentions that with their close association with the Angles as well as Bede's mention of their ruler Witta being the grandfather of Hengest, it is not unreasonable ot infer that they took part in the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Britannia (201).
Match found Ænēnas -> Anenas, an unidentified tribe, potentially Aunonia of Kossinna argued by Malone pg 127
Match found Seaxan -> The original Saxons of Germany
Match found Sycga -> @@@
Match found Sweordwere -> From Tacitus, as Malone so adeptly argues in 202-203.
Match found Hronan -> a tribe otherwise unknown. Lots of possibilities (Malone 176).
Match found Dēan -> unknown tribe in the southern Scandinavian peninsula, the Daukiones of Ptolemy (ii.11.16, Malone 135)
Match found Heaþoreamas -> @@@
Match found Þyringas -> Either the Thoringi of Gregory of Tours or the Tungri (Thuringians) of inland Germany. It is not impossible that these are actually the same tribe. (Malone 206)
Match found Þrowend -> The inhabitants of Norway's Trøndelagen, the Þrøndr (Malone 205).
Match found Burgendan -> a Germanic tribe dwelling in the Rhine region and later the Rhone.
Match found Guðhere -> King of the Burgundians, Gunter/Gunther of OHG, who was defeated by the Huns in the Nibelungenlied, Þiðrikssaga, and the Volsungasaga.
Match found Froncan -> @@@
Match found Frēsan -> @@@
Match found Frumtingas -> The people of King Framta, a faction of the Suevi in Spain. See <i>Historia Svevorum</i>(Malone 152)
Match found Rugas -> @@@ Who are the Rugis??
Match found Glomman -> A tribe perhaps the same as Tacitus's Lemovii on the Oder estuary.
Match found Rumwalas -> Malone (193) identifies the Rumwalas as the eastern Roman empire, which is heavily disputed by other authors @@@ Check Weiskott
Match found Eatul -> Italy
Match found Ælfwine -> King Alboin of the Langobards, called Elvewine in König Rother(Gillespie 36)
Match found Eadwine -> @@@ Audoin, again
Match found Sercingas -> Perhaps Tacitus's Siraci, a Black Sea tribe, or perhaps the Serica of the ancients (Sedgefield 1922, 136), though Malone notes this would then connect them with the Serkland and Serkir in the same line (197).
Match found Seringas -> The Serae of the ancients,
Match found Creacas -> interesting to note that this is not the Romans any more
Match found Finnas -> @@@
Match found Casere -> Malone argues on pg 135 for an Eastern Roman emperor here, possibly Justinian
Match found Walas -> A generic word meaning 'foreigners' but usually referring to Romans. This name was later to be come the appelation given to the land of 'Wales' or of 'foreigners'
Match found Scottas -> Not the Scots
Match found Peohtas -> @@@
Match found Scridefinnas -> The Lapps of arctic Norway, Scride- (skis) exists to differentiate them from the Finns proper.
Match found Lidwicingas -> Malone emends this to Lidingum and associates them with the Liðungar of Islenzkir Analar, but others associate it as is with the Lidwiccas in the <i>OE Annals</i>. I have chosen to leave it unchanged for the moment
Match found Leonas -> @@@
Match found Longbeardan -> @@@
Match found Hundingas -> nickname for the Langobards
Match found Israhelas -> @@@
Match found Exsyringas -> @@@
Match found Ebreas -> @@@
Match found Indeas -> Inhabitants of India
Match found Egypte -> @@@
Match found Moide -> Malone 183: Moide are the inhabitates of Møn in the Danish archipelago, and a well known harbor and battle-site. Earlier editors associated the Moide with the Medes but this spelling would be a one-off then, as the Medes are usuall spelled Meðas or Mœðe.
Match found Perse -> because of the exotic peoples listed in the previous sentence, these often get translated to the Medes and the Persians; however, Malone points out that in this couplet, they are actually paired with Scandinavian and Germanic tribes. Because of this, the identity of the Perse is unknown.
Match found Myrgingas -> the tribe to which Widsið belonged. 'By virtue of the Offa episode, the Myrgings can be localized with some precision; they lived south of the river Eider, in a region apparently identical with that held by the Saxons of Ptolemy and certainly identical with that held by the Nordalbings of later times, themselves a branch of the Old Saxons (to use King Alfred's term).' (Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.
Match found Mofdingas -> Malone changes this to the 'Ofdingas' for complex reasons. Nobody else does this, so I have elected to leave it, though he makes a compelling argument (pg2 186-187).
Match found Ongendmyrgingas -> Malone has this combined with the previous word to form the Ongendmyrgingum but neither Chambers nor the ASPR does this. If it were correct, it might be identical to the later Wiþmyrgingas in 116. Malone takes his cue from Rieger and Langenfelt in following the structure of 'Ongendþeow' and placing the Ongend as a prefix of the word. Because of the presence of the 'regular' Myrgings in this same stanza, I have opted for Malone's reading.
Match found Amoþingas -> Inhabitants of the island of Hindø in Norway, which appears in cap. 29 of the <i>Ynglingasaga</i> by Snorri
Match found Eastþyringas -> @@@ Still the best sausages in Germany
Match found Ilwan -> The Elvaeones of Ptolemy, the Helvecones of Tacitus
Match found Iste -> A specific tribe of the Ostrogoths
Match found Idumingas -> Ydumaci of Henricus Lettus, a Livonian tribe.
Match found Eormanrīc -> Ostrogothic king in the late middle 4th century, see his contemporary historian, Ammanius Marcellinus, as well as Jordanes. Ammanius tells that his great empire was so threatened by Huns and Alans that he committed suicide, though Jordanes leaves this out (Malone 146). Son of Amelunc and uncle of Dietrich von Berne (Þeodric), <i>Dietrichs Flucht</i> paints him very badly, as do other Old German heroic tales (Gillespie 37, 38). Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149).
Match found Gotan -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths
Match found Eadgils -> King of the Myrgings, otherwise unknown. Malone has LOTS to say on pgs 137-139
Match found Myrgingas -> the tribe to which Widsið belonged. 'By virtue of the Offa episode, the Myrgings can be localized with some precision; they lived south of the river Eider, in a region apparently identical with that held by the Saxons of Ptolemy and certainly identical with that held by the Nordalbings of later times, themselves a branch of the Old Saxons (to use King Alfred's term).' (Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.
Match found Ealhhild -> Eadwine's daughter
Match found Eadwine -> @@@ Audoin, again
Match found Scilling -> A scop who sang with Widsith on at least one occasion, Malone compares this to rune-singers in Finnish tradition (194).
Match found Gotan -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths
Match found Eormanrīc -> Ostrogothic king in the late middle 4th century, see his contemporary historian, Ammanius Marcellinus, as well as Jordanes.

Malone argues that these later heroic tales do not reflect the historical king, who seems to have behaved correctly for an old Germanic warlord (146-149).
Match found Heðca -> Malone corrects this to Hehca, and associates him with 'Hache', a Germanic hero (Malone 168). Anscombe 1916 amends it to Hæþcan and identifies the character with King Hæðcyn of Beowulf.
Match found Beadeca -> @@@
Match found Herelingas -> The followers of Herela, or King Herla of Water Map, the leader of the Wild Host (or Woden in disguise), but the poet here is likely referring to the Harlun brothers (Malone 170).
Match found Emerca -> Emerca is the Gothic hero Erpamara, found in Jordanes 43
Match found Fridla -> Gothic king Fridigernus
Match found Eastgota -> Early king of the Ostrogoths, contemporary of Roman Emperor Philip (244-9) (Malone 142)
Match found Unwen -> Son of Eastgota l 113, meaning 'unexpected one'
Match found Secca -> The young Sigiwald of history, kinsmen of the Frankish Þeodric. His story is found in Gregory of Tours' <i>Historia Fancorum iii</i> (Malone 196).
Match found Becca -> Berchtung of the Wolfdietrich story, occaisionally also indentified with the evil Bikki but this Becca is clearly in the wrong company to be associated wtih that story
Match found Seafola -> A legendary traitorous retainer from the Wolfdietrich tale, according to Malone 194-195. Chambers instead has this as Sabene of Rabene in the Dietrich von Berne story (see Gillespie 28).
Match found Þeodric -> Malone has him as the oldest son of Clovis and king of the Franks, and says that this Theodric is the same Theodric as in l. 115. Chambers and other dispute this. This Theodric is, indeed, Hugdietrich, king of the Franks (as stated in the poem), but l.115 would then be Dietrich of Bern.
Match found Heaþoric -> Malone  states that this is the Heiðrekr of the <i>Harvararsaga</i>, and while the phonology does not precisely align, the three remaining names in this line are all from <i>Hervararsaga</i>. He also draws a connection between this Heaþoric and the Hæðcyn of <i>Beowulf</i>.
Match found Sifeca -> An evil counselor of unknown origin but with lots of speculation (Malone 199).
Match found Hlīþe -> Hlǫðr of the HErvararsaga, Lotherus of Saxo Grammaticus, a mythical Gothic or Geatish king, though in the past he was identified with King Leth of the Langobards (Grienberger 1922, 377)
Match found Incgenþeow -> Angantyr of the Hervararsaga and the historical King Ongenþeow of Sweden, who appears in Beowulf.
Match found Eadwine -> @@@ Audoin, again
Match found Elsa -> based on context, ought to be a Langobardish hero, but otherwise unknown
Match found Ægelmund -> first king of the Langobards
Match found Hungar -> Second king of the Langobards, also called Lamissio by Paulus Diaconus.
Match found Wiþmyrgingas -> @@@ need to check Chambers 123, 215, 221, but Malone (211) has these as the Myrgings who dwell in the valley of the With (Vid) river, and perhaps identical to the Ongendmyrgings.
Match found Wulfhere -> One of two princes of the Hræde who let their people in a war against the Huns (Malone 213).
Match found Wyrmhere -> The Ormarr of the <i>Hervararsaga</i>, also the Olimarus of Saxo's 5th book. One of two princes of the Hræde who let their people in a war against the Huns (Malone 214).
Match found Hræde -> @@@
Match found Wistlawudu -> The forest of the Vistula goths
Match found Ætla -> the Hun.
Match found Rædhere -> an unknown king or hero, whose name means 'command (or counsel) the army'.
Match found Rondhere -> unknown hero whose name means shield-army, or less literally, 'protector'.
Match found Rumstan ->  often connected with the Germanic hero Rimstien, but Widsith seems to associate him with Gislhere of the Burgundians and the German hero is a Goth. Malone (192) supposes the hero was forgotten and then his name reborrowed as the Gothic legend cycle grew.
Match found Gislhere -> King of the Burgundians, who Malone speculates would have been an ancestor of the more famous Guðhere
Match found Wiþergield -> The Wiðergyld of Beowulf 2051, a Heathobeard.
Match found Freoþerīc -> unidentified king or hero, sometimes conneced with the Heathobards and other times with Rederic, King of the Rugians, but Malone mentions there is no evidence for this (150).
Match found Wudga -> THe hero Widia from <i>Waldere</i> and the Viðga of <i>Þiðrrikssaga</i>
Match found Hama -> The Heime of German lore, an exile who has carved out a kingdom for himself and is paired in this poem with Wudga. Malone states that the poet clearly thought of them as joint rulers of a single kingdom, though Chambers argues they were outlaws a la Robin Hood (pg 159-160). This is the Hama of Beowulf who carried off the bright necklace of the Brosings.
