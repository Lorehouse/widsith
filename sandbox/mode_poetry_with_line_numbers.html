     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="49">and at Heorot cut to pieces the force of the Heathobards.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="50">As I traversed many foreign lands</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="51">throughout a wide region, good and evil</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="52">I experienced there, deprived of my people,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="53">far from generous kinsmen, and served far and wide.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="54">Therefore I will sing and speak a tale,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="55">Making known before the company in the mead-hall</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="56">how the well-born would be generous with choice gifts to me.</div><br/>

     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="63">With the Hronan I was and the Deans and with the Heathoramas.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="64">With the Thuringians I was and with the Throwend</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="65">and with the Burgundians; There I received a necklace;</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="66">there Guthhere gave a goodly treasure</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="67">to reward songs; that king was not stingy!</div><br/>

     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="72">the quickest hand to earning praise,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="73">a generous heart distributing rings</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="74">bright treasures, that son of Edwin!</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="75">With the Sercings I was and with the Serae.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="76">With the Greeks I was and with the Finns and with Caesar,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="77">he who ruled over many towns of revelry,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="78">possessed riches and treasures and the realm of the Romans.</div><br/>

     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="81">With heathens and with heroes and with the Hundings (could heathens and heroes be puns?).</div><br/>

     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="87">and with the Ilwan and with the Austrogoths and Idumings.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="88">And I was with Ermanric all the time,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="89">There the king of the Goths was good and generous to me,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="90">first among the townspeople, gave me a ring</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="91">in which of refined gold, the count of</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="92">six hundred shillings were reckoned,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="93">Which I gave into the possession of Eadgils,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="94">my lord protector, when I came home,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="95">to my beloved lord because it was he who gave me land,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="96">the king of the Myrgings, my father's inheritance.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="97">And then to me Ealhhild gave a second ring,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="98">the queen of the army fighting men, the daughter of Edwin.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="99">Her praise stretched throughout many lands</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="100">when I in song must say</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="101">where under the sky I best knew</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="102">the gold-adorned queen distributing gifts.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="103">Then with Scilling our clear voices</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="104">we raised before our victory lord</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="105">loudly with harp, singing loud to the harp</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="106">then many men of proud spirits</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="107">who had good knowledge spoke words</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="108">that they had never heard a better song.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="109">Thence I traversed all the land of the Ostrogoths,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="110">I sought the best battle comrades</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="111">that was ever the household of Ermanric.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="112">Hache I sought and Beadecan and the Herelingas</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="113">Emerca I sought and Fridla and the East-goths,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="114">wise and good, father of Unwen</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="115">Seccan I sought and Beccan, Seafola and Theodric</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="116">Heathoric and Sifecta, Lotherus and Incgentheow.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="117">Edwin I sought and Elsa, Agelmund and Hungar,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="118">and the proud company of the Withmyrgings.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="119">Wulfhere I sought and Wyrmhere, very often warfare was not at rest</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="120">when the Hraede army with hard swords</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="121">around the Wistle wood must defend</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="122">the ancestral lands of Attila's people.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="123">Raedhere I sought and Rondhere, Rumstan and Gislaharius,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="124">Withergield and Freotheric, Wudga and Hama</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="125">there were not the worst comrades in arms</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="126">Though I mention them at the last.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="127">Very often from that company flew the whining</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="128">and shrieking spear against a hostile people.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="129">Wanderers there ruled with wound gold</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="130">over men and women, Wudga and Hama.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="131">Thus I have always found it in journeying</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="132">that they be dearest to their subjects</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="133">whom God has given the right to rule men</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="134">for holding while he lives here.</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="135">Thus are fated to wandering and roving</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="136">are the minstrel men throughout many regions,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="137">saying at need, speaking thank-words,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="138">always meeting someone south or north</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="139">appreciative of poems with generous gifts for those</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="140">who before military men will will heighten their reputation</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="141">to do valorous deeds until everything passes,</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="142">light and life together. He who works for praise</div><br/>
     <div class="poetry-line" data-line="143">has under the heavens lasting glory.</div><br/>
