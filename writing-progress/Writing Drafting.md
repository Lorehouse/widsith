# Widsith and the Digital Age

## Introduction

### What is Widsith?

### Thesis Statement

## Literary Review

Why Widsith? Of all the prose and poetry in the Old English corpus, what makes this poem such an appealing seminal project? Unlike, say, The Wanderer or The Seafarer, Widsith is filled with references to people and places both mythical and historical. It also is only 143 lines long, making this a manageable example work which can be thoroughly annotated and displayed. For instance, Beowulf also contains plentiful references to named entities that are known from other sources, but its unwieldy 3,182 lines of inconsistent quality make it a significantly more advanced project.

From a literary standpoint, Widsith has little to offer, its narrative moments being more in passing references to other, better-known stories from Norse, Old English, Old High German, or even Roman and Greek texts. But this state as a central meeting point of a great variety of literature from many cultures and languages makes it a central node in an imaginary graph linking references to one another. From Hrothulf of Beowulf one can travel through Widsith's Hrothwulf, to Hróarr of Hrólfr Kraki's Saga. Or through Widsith one can move from Beowulf to the writings of Jordanes, from obvious fiction to dubious history. As a pivot point joining the work of many different fields of literary and historical scholarship, Widsith is an excellent starting point.

There are roughly 137 named entities within the poem, though some of them are mentioned twice. These named entities encompass the categories of individuals, people groups, regions of land, and individual locations. By the way they are grouped, inferences can be made about the associations between various groups of people, and the context of an ambiguous name can help scholars decide on its possible identification. Many locations are known to geography still today, but others, while they can be linked to references in Tacitus or Jordanes, cannot be linked to any modern region or landmark.

### Print Editions

While Widsith has received less scholarly attention than some more exciting narratives, it has been well-researched nevertheless, and there are two excellent print scholarly editions. The earlier is by R. W. Chambers and was published in 1912. It is full of excellent notes and extremely detailed commentary. The later, though not much, is the Kemp Malone edition from 1936, revised in a second edition of 1962, is heavily concerned with the meter of and alliteration of the text in the commentary but contains a rich and detailed named-entities glossary at the back as well. Neither of these versions is without their controversies, however: the Chambers edition is quite dated now and scholarship has progressed significantly since its publication, while the Malone version contains personal theories and biases that do not align with general scholarly consensus, and he rearranges the poem (in one area fairly significantly) to suit what he believes the correct metrical and alliterative form to be.

### Digital Editions

Digitally, Widsith has not been neglected either. Martin Foys's Old English Poetry in Facsimile (OEPF) Project, hosted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, contains high-quality scans of the text aligned with a facsimile version, as well as an unaligned translation. The OEPF interface makes use of the flexibility of digital text to allow for this visual alignment as well as navigability between poems and sections of the poems, and highlighting to demonstrate what sections of the facsimile edition align with specific portions of the manuscript. For scholars focused on manuscript studies, this is an excellent and well-designed resource.

### My Edition

The goal of my edition of Widsith is not to compete with the OEPF version, but to expand on it. I have not created a facsimile edition from the manuscript, nor do I have scans of the text to display. Instead, my goal is to make a version of the poem that can be trusted to reflect general scholarly consensus of the text, aligned with translation and part-of-speech tagging. The audience is that of the literary and philological scholar who may or may not have a working knowledge of the language, rather than the digital humanist or the strict historian.

By providing word forms and part-of-speech tagging, as well as a line-by-line alignment of the text, I allow students of the poem to engage with the language closely, but also to take a step back and view the whole poem, aligned between Old English and Modern English, to gain context on the greater content. This approach is amenable to language-learners who wish to engage with the text in the original language without doing their own translation, or constantly swapping back and forth with a glossary, but also allows scholars who wish to study the poem without learning an historical language to still interact with it in the context of that language.

### What is a digital text?
What differentiates a digital edition from a print edition? This question at first has a simple, obvious answer: one exists in paper and ink, the other on a computer screen. While not factually untrue, this does not begin to do justice to the history and possibilities of either edition. A print edition has features that a digital edition should not pretend to, and a digital edition has possibilities that the constrains of print media could not attain to.

A print edition is limited by the medium of the codex form. The vast ideas of mankind cannot be contained on a page-by-page system, yet for hundreds of years, this was the main and best way of containing and conveying information to as wide an audience as possible. Therefore, choices had to be made. An excellent example of this exists in the _Widsith_ body of scholarship, in the differences between the Chambers and the Malone scholarly editions. Both of these editions display a deep knowledge of the language, the history, and the text. In dealing with the difficulties of displaying the poem in its original language while also annotating it for linguistic features, historical facts, and references to other scholarship and literary references, however, the space constraints demanded they make choices, and they made very different choices.

Chambers's text is characterized by footnotes on each page, often so extensive that the poem itself is limited to only four or even a single line on that page followed by a large block of notes. The benefits of this choice are clear: fluidity of reading is sacrificed for the sake of referencing convenience. Malone makes the opposite choice, printing the versions of his poem in a single chunk followed by notes on the text referring back to line numbers. This decision allows the poem to be seen at once and its brevity to be taken in as well as its overall structure, something that Malone makes much of. In study, however, it necessitates a constant flipping back of pages to compare the notes to the poem. Neither method is superior, they simply emphasize different goals of the editor and allow for different reading experiences.

A digital edition does not have page constraints. The poem can easily be displayed entirely on one page with no flipping or turn. Hyperlinks mean that one can switch from text to notes without hunting for line numbers. This is a feature that many ebook readers have used to great effect, while still maintaining similar sensations to that of print media. An ebook, however, chooses to be held to the constraints of a book with only minor convenience additions to provide a familiar experience to a reader. A truly digital edition does not need to bother with that sense of familiarity. As digital libraries have grown and evolved, they have been able to shake off the lingering habits of print media and embrace more fully the potential of the digital medium.

While this edition does not, due to time constraints, display the wide capabilities of digital editions as much as I should like, the ability to experience the poem, with its modern alignment, as a single monolith, as well as the ability to read it with notes on each individual lines, does to an extent demonstrate the ability. Additionally, there exists a single glossary page and a single named-entities glossary page to recreate the experience of that section of a text at the back of the book. They can, however, be accessed by hyperlink now, and the search bar enables rapid locating of the desired word or entity.

### References and other digital libraries

### XML and tagging
How does a digital edition come into being, then? The answer to this question obviously varies greatly from text to text, but the process for this Widsith began with finding a few authoritative versions of the poem, as well as comparison with the manuscript. Scans of the manuscript are available at both the Old English Poetry in Facsimile project, as well as the University of Exeter Digital Humanities lab. It was not my goal to produce a facsimile edition from the manuscript, so I only used the scans for reference as I built my own edition and did not work directly from them for extensive periods. I also gathered Chambers's, Malone's, and the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Record's. From here I did a light markup of each in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) for ease of alignment and comparison.

XML is the foundation of most digital editions, as it allows the writer to add machine-readable tags and then write scripts in a programming language (mine is Python) to do large-scale work on the text that would be onerous to do manually. A sample below shows the markup on my own edition of Widsith.

## The Future
In thinking about the possibilities for this digital edition, it was critical to look into the existing digital libraries, which are plentiful, to understand both what was possible and what was important. The key decision was from the beginning identifying the audience that might benefit most from this edition. One of the issues facing digital editions is that, as Rasmussen describes, "it is possible that these changes have been driven less by the concrete use of new media than by assumptions about their potential" (120). **@@@Question for Dr. Crane about usage vs possibilities.** The ability to consult with Dr. Gregory Crane of Tufts University and creator of the Perseus Digital Library, one of most well-established and respected digital libraries in existence, was invaluable in discerning and prioritizing. In considering Rasmussen's three categories of reader roles, reader, user and co-worker, as applied to digital scholarly editions, I had to consider what sort of reader, user, or co-worker would join me on this endeavor.

The reader to whom I geared this project was the student or the hobbyist. This person would not expect to contribute in any way and would be here simply for the most practical, accessible version of the text -- a free, open-source, and reliable version that aided them in their language journey. This reader would get the greatest benefit from the simple side-by-side alignment and possibly the named-entities glossary, which would allow them to read the modern English text fluidly.

The user is somebody with a more philological purpose. They want to see how this text functions within itself and within the greater body of Old English poetry. For this user, the line-by-line view, with its stricter translation of individual words, its wooden translation, and the access to lemma and part-of-speech tags will be more useful. This along with the named-entity information would allow them to understand the historical societies and contexts included in the poem, and be a jumping-off point for their own further research.

The co-worker is the reader for whom I have done the least preparation, but for whom I have the greatest future hopes. This person would be an enthusiastic student of Old English and want to annotate and contribute their own texts and translations to the project. Because there is no graphic interface for the co-worker, everything would require a low-level knowledge of XML and possibly Python. The scripts I have written, however, are as broad as possible to allow for a variety of possibilities. Once the poem was properly tagged, it is hardly more than the push of a button to generate the HTML page that displays on the site. Every time the text was updated, it could easily be freshly generated and pushed to the site again, allowing for constant updates.

These three roles--reader, user, co-worker--are not discrete individuals but "they should rather be regarded as modalities" (Rasmussen, 127). The greatest hope for this _Widsith_ edition is that its initial accessibility to the reader would inspire greater curiosity, allowing the casual visitor to become a user who could reference the work repeatedly and gain greater understanding. The final hope for at least a few of these users would be to instill a desire to contribute and continue this work. There can be no doubt to the academically-minded that the greatest thrill of engaging with a text or an edition is when one can become part of its process. By making the transition from reader to user to co-worker simple and graspable, I hope to support budding scholars in their own growth and enthusiasm.

This leads us to the future of this project. What hopes for the future can be safely cherished? This edition is already prepared for incorporation in the Perseus Digital Library, and all the files will be available for anyone who wants to use this edition to build upon. Perseus has a long history of contribution by scholars, and my hope is that we can build within that existing structure rather than requiring me to create something new, incrementally, from scratch. Because Perseus already contains a wealth of Greek and Latin texts, many of which share references within _Widsith_, I hope that the linking of these references might be made simpler. Also, by working within such a strong existing framework, I don't create yet another site for scholars to visit; this is a single location where one can interact with a multitude of texts.

In the longer term, I hope that not only I, but other scholars who want to join me, can mark up more and more of the Old English Poetic Corpus and easily integrate them into Perseus. There is simply not enough lifetime for me to do this on my own, but slowly and surely I believe there is great potential for all of these texts, in a reliable scholarly form, to be collected in one place, and surrounded by the digital tools to allow richer close scrutiny and distant study.
