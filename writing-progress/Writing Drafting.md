# Widsith and the Digital Age

## Introduction


### What is Widsith?
Widsið spoke.

When one speaks, what is the implication? If a writer writes, "Jack said", there is a sense that he is merely speaking in a normal way and the writer is conveying that information. However, if the same passage instead says "Jack spoke", it implies that there is significance to the speech. There has been silence from Jack; he was not speaking before (this is not an assumption with "said" as it may be relaying just a part of a continuous speech). There is significance to Jack's speaking; perhaps he made an announcement, or spoke over a device like a phone, or on behalf of somebody. It is not merely saying.

When _Widsið_ opens, it opens with _Widsið maðolade_: "Widsith spoke". In an oral culture, perhaps this was performed before an opening chord to call the crowd's attention to the performance, or perhaps it was preceded by an anticipatory silence. With the breaking of the silence in the world of the poem, the silence in the primary world is also broken. The poet spoke, and Widsið spoke.

The audience listens, aware of the significance of this statement, aware that the silence has been broken for a purpose, and eager to discover that purpose. The audience has continued to listen, or rather to read, as the poem came down to us in the Exeter Book and has been the study of many brilliant scholars over the last few hundred years.

The Exeter Book itself is one of the oldest manuscripts we have in Old English, usually dated as having been compiled in the late 10th century. The poems contained therein are older, some perhaps much older, and of these the one usually dated as the oldest of all is _Widsið_. There is considerable debate among scholars as to how old the poem is. The nature of the poem itself is a catalogue poem, detailing lists of kings, peoples, and heroes, held within a story of a poet who has traveled widely--hence his name: Widsith; literally "wide-journey".

Fragments of the lists may be of varying ages, and later compiled together by a single poet, who is not presumed to be the scribe. It is one of these fragments that Alfred Anscombe dated as far back as 460 AD, and Kemp Malone proposed the compilation of the whole dated no later than the late 7th century. Later authors reject these early dates, but as Neidorf notes that "Frank, Hill, and Niles offer no substantial engagement with the dating arguments of earlier _Widsið_ scholars. The reader is simply left to imagine that there really is no evidence for an early dating of _Widsið_ and that scholarship had operated under a delusion for over 100 and 50 years" (166). Using onomastic evidence and dialectic vocabulary, as well as the absence of the Saxons from the poem, pretty significant oversight if it was written at a later date when the Saxons were a dominant people, Neidorf argues adeptly for sustaining the earlier dating. Weiskott refutes Neidorf's orthographical examples on the grounds that a poet copying lists would copy their original orthography, arguing a later date from a metrical standpoint. Pascual also takes up the argument, siding rather on the early end, also with a metrical perspective. The back and forth between these three terrific scholars is an interesting read and also strongly motivating to scholars who want to dive into this text for themselves.
### Thesis Statement

The age and content of _Widsið_ are what make it such an excellent project for digital representation. The long catalogues of names and people, now figures of a shadowy past, can be overwhelming. The fact that the poem, though short at only 143 lines, does not have a strong narrative arc, means that it is not a first choice for students of Old English. Yet the language is clear and systematic, and the repeated syntax excellent for reinforcing linguistic concepts to young language learners. When one reads _Helm Wulfingum_ (29), it is apparent that _Helm_ is in the nominative with no ending, and _Wulfingum_ in the plural dative "-um" ending rather than the nominative "-as" to demonstrate Helm "verbed" (in this case _weold_) the Wulfings. This pattern is then repeated over and over with almost no variation except when _Finn Folcwalding_ _[weold] Frēsna cynne_ (27), or when _Hringweald wæs haten Herefarena cyning_. These exceptions would then stand out because of their difference from the pattern and introduce new concepts.

Beyond that, the ability of digital technology to provide hyperlinking of texts and information sites, allowing quick access to information on named entities, makes _Widsið_ an appealing project. The potential of a digital edition of a text to make it accessible to casual readers, students, and high-level scholars is a flexibility and breadth of reach that a paper text would struggle or fail to live up to.

## Literary Review

Why Widsith? Of all the prose and poetry in the Old English corpus, what makes this poem such an appealing seminal project? Unlike, say, The Wanderer or The Seafarer, Widsith is filled with references to people and places both mythical and historical. It also is only 143 lines long, making this a manageable example work which can be thoroughly annotated and displayed. For instance, Beowulf also contains plentiful references to named entities that are known from other sources, but its unwieldy 3,182 lines of inconsistent quality make it a significantly more advanced project.

From a literary standpoint, Widsith has little to offer, its narrative moments being more in passing references to other, better-known stories from Norse, Old English, Old High German, or even Roman and Greek texts. But this state as a central meeting point of a great variety of literature from many cultures and languages makes it a central node in an imaginary graph linking references to one another. From Hrothulf of Beowulf one can travel through Widsith's Hrothwulf, to Hróarr of Hrólfr Kraki's Saga. Or through Widsith one can move from Beowulf to the writings of Jordanes, from obvious fiction to dubious history. As a pivot point joining the work of many different fields of literary and historical scholarship, Widsith is an excellent starting point.

There are roughly 137 named entities within the poem, though some of them are mentioned twice. These named entities encompass the categories of individuals, people groups, regions of land, and individual locations. By the way they are grouped, inferences can be made about the associations between various groups of people, and the context of an ambiguous name can help scholars decide on its possible identification. Many locations are known to geography still today, but others, while they can be linked to references in Tacitus or Jordanes, cannot be linked to any modern region or landmark.

### Print Editions

While Widsith has received less scholarly attention than some more exciting narratives, it has been well-researched nevertheless, and there are two excellent print scholarly editions. The earlier is by R. W. Chambers and was published in 1912. It is full of excellent notes and extremely detailed commentary. Chambers spends considerable time on the historical details of the text, especially the various peoples and legends. His review of the poem is largely as a historical document that details main heroes and legends that the Anglo-Saxons wanted to preserve. He references works largely by German and Dutch authors and there is much dispute about the divisions of the poem and the various antiquity of these divisions. This view of the poem as a historical document seems reflective of Anglo-Saxon studies and Germanic philology of the period.

The later edition, though not by much, is the Kemp Malone from 1936, revised in a second edition in 1962. Malone focuses much less on the historical aspects of the text, approaching it less as a list of names for dissection and more as a narrative, and a linguistically interesting and purposeful work in its own right.[^1] Malone is heavily concerned with the meter of and alliteration of the text in the commentary but his edition still contains a rich and detailed named-entities glossary at the back as well. Neither of these versions is without their controversies, however: the Chambers edition is quite dated now and scholarship has progressed significantly since its publication, while the Malone version contains personal theories and biases that do not align with general scholarly consensus, and he rearranges the poem (in one area fairly significantly) to suit what he believes the correct metrical and alliterative form to be. 
The rearrangements, while significant, are not out of line with scholarship that had gone before--indeed, Chambers mentions substantial rearrangement and even sections completely removed from the poem by previous scholars trying to approximate the earliest form of the text (or texts). Because this edition aims to present the text as it comes to us, with the scholar making their own decisions regarding the meter or logical ordering of the text, I have not changed any lines or word order.

### Digital Editions

Digitally, Widsith has not been neglected either. Martin Foys's Old English Poetry in Facsimile (OEPF) Project, hosted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, contains high-quality scans of the text aligned with a facsimile version, as well as an unaligned translation. The OEPF interface makes use of the flexibility of digital text to allow for this visual alignment as well as navigability between poems and sections of the poems, and highlighting to demonstrate what sections of the facsimile edition align with specific portions of the manuscript. For scholars focused on manuscript studies, this is an excellent and well-designed resource.

### My Edition

The goal of my edition of *Widsith* is not to compete with the OEPF version, but to expand on it. I have not created a facsimile edition from the manuscript, nor do I have scans of the text to display. Instead, my goal is to make a version of the poem that can be trusted to reflect general scholarly consensus of the text, aligned with translation and part-of-speech tagging. I have made very few changes to the text as it is derived from the manuscript. A few words that are obviously in error (the equivalent of a modern typo) and universally corrected have been changed, but these are not many. The audience is that of the literary and philological scholar who may or may not have a working knowledge of the language, rather than the digital humanist or the strict historian.

By providing word forms and part-of-speech tagging, as well as a line-by-line alignment of the text, I allow students of the poem to engage with the language closely, but also to take a step back and view the whole poem, aligned between Old English and Modern English, to gain context on the greater content. This approach is amenable to language-learners who wish to engage with the text in the original language without doing their own translation, or constantly swapping back and forth with a glossary, but also allows scholars who wish to study the poem without learning an historical language to still interact with it in the context of that language.

## Working with the Historical Text

#### The Structure of Widsith
The poem opens with nine introductory lines that form a frame narrative for the body of the poem and introduce the scop after whom the poem is named. "Widsith spoke, unlocked his wordhoard." It gives a brief introduction to this well-traveled poet, a man of the tribe of the Myrgings who traveled with Ealhhilde to meet with her husband Ermanric, king of the Ostrogoths. In line 10, Widsith begins his own poem, declaring, "I have learned from many about those who wield power!" _"Fela ic monna gefrægn mǣgþum wealdan!"_

From here the poem forms a few main sections. Chambers divides the poem into two main sections: the Catalogue of Kings, and the Lay of Ealhhild and Eormanric. He proposes that these separate sections were originally individual works brought together by a third narrative about a scop traveling to Eormanric that conveniently could tie in both poems. Malone divides it slightly differently, with nine lines of prologue, seven of introduction and interpolation by the poet, three fits that contain a thula[^2], and nine lines of epilogue. These divisions are entirely based on his reading of the third-person and first-person segments and how they function within the poem in either a lyrical or formulaic manner. He is less likely to view the internal units as pre-existing large works and tends to view *Widsith* as more of a patchwork, incorporating various bits and being carefully assembled by a shrewd poet or scribe who added the nine-line prologue and epilogue, creating a pleasing symmetry.

The thulas are very clear, however, and there are obviously three. The first stretches from line 18 through line 35, following the _"X weold X"_ pattern, beginning with _Ætla weold Hunum, Eormanric Gotum,_ (18) and ending with _Offa weold Ongle, Alewih Denum;_" (35). This is apparently a good place to break off the list as the next few lines expand on Offa's prowess in battle and continue on to describe other great figures, such as the famous Ingeld, Hroþwulf, and Hroðgar of _Beowulf_. Even Heorot, that glorious mead-hall of the Danes, gets a mention.

The second thula uses the formulaic first person, saying _"mid X ic wæs ond mid X..."_, going from line 57 to line 87. This second thula, however, has one substantial and two minor interruptions. The first is two lines long and comes after the Burgundians are mentioned, expanding on the generosity of their king. A few more people are named and then the poet briefly expands on the generosity of Ælfwine and Eadwine in Italy. The final brief interruption describes Caesar, ruler of the Greeks and Romans and his many wine-towns.

After this third thula is what could properly be called Chambers's lay of Eormanric and Ealhhild. He starts this section echoing the rhetorical structure of the thula, stating _"Ond ic wæs mid Eormanrīce..._" (88). This lay stretches until line 111, singing the praises of Ermaric and his wife Ealhhild, when it goes into the final thula. Again, the poet builds artful transition into the thula by mirroring the upcoming pattern in the last sentence of the lay:  
"Ðonan ic ealne geondhwearf  ēþel Gotena,  
sōhte ic a gesiþa  þā selestan;  
þæt wæs innweorud  Earmanrīces"(109-111).[^3]

This last thula is less cohesive than the previous two, with frequent one-line or even two-line interruptions. All in all it stretches thirteen lines, but of those only eight follow the pattern "_X sōhte ic ond X"_. These men are the men he sought immediately before the thula as great warriors, and he ends the thula describing their battles and travels together.

It is at this point that the first-person narrative ends and it is not unreasonable to assume this is where the prologue begins, wrapping up the frame narrative with which the poem opened. The poet (no longer Widsith, as his speech has ended), states that the life of the scop is that of wandering and seeking out great warriors to immortalize in song to those who will pay for it. The final line declares that "He who works for praise has under the heavens lasting glory" (143). It is, perhaps, up to the reader to decide who has the greater share of the praise in _Widsith_: the kings and warrior, or the scop himself.

## Working with the digital text

### What is a digital text?
What differentiates a digital edition from a print edition? This question at first has a simple, obvious answer: one exists in paper and ink, the other on a computer screen. While not factually untrue, this does not begin to do justice to the history and possibilities of either edition. A print edition has features that a digital edition should not pretend to, and a digital edition has possibilities that the constrains of print media could not attain to.

A print edition is limited by the medium of the codex form. The vast ideas of mankind cannot be contained on a page-by-page system, yet for hundreds of years, this was the main and best way of containing and conveying information to as wide an audience as possible. Therefore, choices had to be made. An excellent example of this exists in the _Widsith_ body of scholarship, in the differences between the Chambers and the Malone scholarly editions. Both of these editions display a deep knowledge of the language, the history, and the text. In dealing with the difficulties of displaying the poem in its original language while also annotating it for linguistic features, historical facts, and references to other scholarship and literary references, however, the space constraints demanded they make choices, and they made very different choices.

Chambers's text is characterized by footnotes on each page, often so extensive that the poem itself is limited to only four or even a single line on that page followed by a large block of notes. The benefits of this choice are clear: fluidity of reading is sacrificed for the sake of referencing convenience. Malone makes the opposite choice, printing the versions of his poem in a single chunk followed by notes on the text referring back to line numbers. This decision allows the poem to be seen at once and its brevity to be taken in as well as its overall structure, something that Malone makes much of. In study, however, it necessitates a constant flipping back of pages to compare the notes to the poem. Neither method is superior, they simply emphasize different goals of the editor and allow for different reading experiences.

A digital edition does not have page constraints. The poem can easily be displayed entirely on one page with no flipping or turn. Hyperlinks mean that one can switch from text to notes without hunting for line numbers. This is a feature that many ebook readers have used to great effect, while still maintaining similar sensations to that of print media. An ebook, however, chooses to be held to the constraints of a book with only minor convenience additions to provide a familiar experience to a reader. A truly digital edition does not need to bother with that sense of familiarity. As digital libraries have grown and evolved, they have been able to shake off the lingering habits of print media and embrace more fully the potential of the digital medium.

While this edition does not, due to time constraints, display the wide capabilities of digital editions as much as I should like, the ability to experience the poem, with its modern alignment, as a single monolith, as well as the ability to read it with notes on each individual lines, does to an extent demonstrate the ability. Additionally, there exists a single glossary page and a single named-entities glossary page to recreate the experience of that section of a text at the back of the book. They can, however, be accessed by hyperlink now, and the search bar enables rapid locating of the desired word or entity.

### References and other digital libraries

### XML and tagging
How does a digital edition come into being, then? The answer to this question obviously varies greatly from text to text, but the process for this Widsith began with finding a few authoritative versions of the poem, as well as comparison with the manuscript. Scans of the manuscript are available at both the Old English Poetry in Facsimile project, as well as the University of Exeter Digital Humanities lab. It was not my goal to produce a facsimile edition from the manuscript, so I only used the scans for reference as I built my own edition and did not work directly from them for extensive periods. I also gathered Chambers's, Malone's, and the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Record's. From here I did a light markup of each in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) for ease of alignment and comparison.

XML is the foundation of most digital editions, as it allows the writer to add machine-readable tags and then write scripts in a programming language (mine is Python) to do large-scale work on the text that would be onerous to do manually. A sample below shows the markup on my own edition of Widsith.

## The Future
In thinking about the possibilities for this digital edition, it was critical to look into the existing digital libraries, which are plentiful, to understand both what was possible and what was important. The key decision was from the beginning identifying the audience that might benefit most from this edition. One of the issues facing digital editions is that, as Rasmussen describes, "it is possible that these changes have been driven less by the concrete use of new media than by assumptions about their potential" (120). **@@@Question for Dr. Crane about usage vs possibilities.** The ability to consult with Dr. Gregory Crane of Tufts University and creator of the Perseus Digital Library, one of most well-established and respected digital libraries in existence, was invaluable in discerning and prioritizing. In considering Rasmussen's three categories of reader roles, reader, user and co-worker, as applied to digital scholarly editions, I had to consider what sort of reader, user, or co-worker would join me on this endeavor.

The reader to whom I geared this project was the student or the hobbyist. This person would not expect to contribute in any way and would be here simply for the most practical, accessible version of the text -- a free, open-source, and reliable version that aided them in their language journey. This reader would get the greatest benefit from the simple side-by-side alignment and possibly the named-entities glossary, which would allow them to read the modern English text fluidly.

The user is somebody with a more philological purpose. They want to see how this text functions within itself and within the greater body of Old English poetry. For this user, the line-by-line view, with its stricter translation of individual words, its wooden translation, and the access to lemma and part-of-speech tags will be more useful. This along with the named-entity information would allow them to understand the historical societies and contexts included in the poem, and be a jumping-off point for their own further research.

The co-worker is the reader for whom I have done the least preparation, but for whom I have the greatest future hopes. This person would be an enthusiastic student of Old English and want to annotate and contribute their own texts and translations to the project. Because there is no graphic interface for the co-worker, everything would require a low-level knowledge of XML and possibly Python. The scripts I have written, however, are as broad as possible to allow for a variety of possibilities. Once the poem was properly tagged, it is hardly more than the push of a button to generate the HTML page that displays on the site. Every time the text was updated, it could easily be freshly generated and pushed to the site again, allowing for constant updates.

These three roles--reader, user, co-worker--are not discrete individuals but "they should rather be regarded as modalities" (Rasmussen, 127). The greatest hope for this _Widsith_ edition is that its initial accessibility to the reader would inspire greater curiosity, allowing the casual visitor to become a user who could reference the work repeatedly and gain greater understanding. The final hope for at least a few of these users would be to instill a desire to contribute and continue this work. There can be no doubt to the academically-minded that the greatest thrill of engaging with a text or an edition is when one can become part of its process. By making the transition from reader to user to co-worker simple and graspable, I hope to support budding scholars in their own growth and enthusiasm.

This leads us to the future of this project. What hopes for the future can be safely cherished? This edition is already prepared for incorporation in the Perseus Digital Library, and all the files will be available for anyone who wants to use this edition to build upon. Perseus has a long history of contribution by scholars, and my hope is that we can build within that existing structure rather than requiring me to create something new, incrementally, from scratch. Because Perseus already contains a wealth of Greek and Latin texts, many of which share references within _Widsith_, I hope that the linking of these references might be made simpler. Also, by working within such a strong existing framework, I don't create yet another site for scholars to visit; this is a single location where one can interact with a multitude of texts.

In the longer term, I hope that not only I, but other scholars who want to join me, can mark up more and more of the Old English Poetic Corpus and easily integrate them into Perseus. There is simply not enough lifetime for me to do this on my own, but slowly and surely I believe there is great potential for all of these texts, in a reliable scholarly form, to be collected in one place, and surrounded by the digital tools to allow richer close scrutiny and distant study.

## Conclusion

[^1]: * It seems significant that this edition of _Widsith,_ so markedly different in tone from Chambers of 24 years before, came out the same year as J. R. R. Tolkien's wildly influential essay, "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics". That essay famously remonstrated philologists for looking "through the text" and not at it (@@@ GET QUOTE), and urged them to look at the poem of Beowulf in its own right as a narrative and a poem. A greater contrast between this view of Beowulf and Chambers "the one poem which happens to have come down to us complete, but of which the plot is singularly poor," can hardly be imagined. While it is impossible to consider Tolkien's essay, delivered in the fall, as having any influence on Malone's book that came out that same year, the coincidence of their mutual change in tone regarding the study of two different Old English poems may signify a shift in focus of philology from a historically-focused discipline to a linguistic and literary focus. No longer concerned with reviving a golden past of the Germanic people (a singularly distasteful idea in the post World War One years), the scholars became free to approach their beloved texts from a new and no less interesting literary angle.

[^2]: A thula is a name-list or a catalogue used often as mnemonic devices and common in old Germanic literature. _Widsith_ is the most widely-known example in Old English literature but the famous dwarf-list of the _Völuspá_ is one of the best known thulas of Germanic literature. Many Eddic poems contain thulas within the larger narrative.

[^3]: "Thence I traversed all the land of the Goths,  
	I sought the best battle comrades  
	that was ever the household of Ermanric."
