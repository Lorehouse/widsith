				<l n="1">Widsith spoke, unlocked his wordhoard,</l>
				<l n="2">he who most of men of all people over the earth</l>
				<l n="3">traveled among tribes; often in great halls he received</l>
				<l n="4">handsome gifts. Noble sons born to him</l>
				<l n="5">of the Myrgings. He with Ealhhilde, </l>
				<l n="6">the fair peace-weaver, on his first journey</l>
				<l n="7">sought the home of the king of the Goths,</l>
				<l n="8">Ermanric, east of the Angle's land,</l>
				<l n="9">hostile oathbreaker. He began then to speak a great many words:</l>
				<l n="10">"I have learned by asking about many men who rule tribes!</l>
				<l n="11">Men shall each live in good custom,</l>
				<l n="12">one leader after another, governing their homeland,</l>
				<l n="13">whoever desires his throne to prosper.</l>
				<l n="14">There was Hwala, for a while the best,</l>
				<l n="15">and Alexander (the Great) most powerful</l>
				<l n="16">of all mankind, and he most throve</l>
				<l n="17">Of those whom I have heard of over the earth.</l>
				<l n="18">Atilla ruled the Huns, Ermanric the Goths,</l>
				<l n="19">Becca the Banings, Gifica the Burgundians.</l>
				<l n="20">Caesar ruled the Greeks and Caelic the Finns,</l>
				<l n="21">Hagena the Rugians, and Heoden the Glomman.</l>
				<l n="22">Witta ruled the Swaefe, Wada Haelsings,</l>
				<l n="23">Meaca Myrgings, Mearchealf the Hundings.</l>
				<l n="24">Theodric ruled the Franks, Thyle the Rondings,</l>
				<l n="25">Breoca the Brondings, Billing the Werns.</l>
				<l n="26">Oswin ruled the Eows and Gefwulf the Jutes,</l>
				<l n="27">Fin Folkwalding the Frisian tribe.</l>
				<l n="28">Sighere ruled the Sea-Danes the longest,</l>
				<l n="29">Hnaef the Hocings, Helm the Wulfings,</l>
				<l n="30">Wald the Woings, Wod the Thuringians,</l>
				<l n="31">Saeferth the Sycgans, Ongendtheow the Swedes,</l>
				<l n="32">Sceafthere the Ymbran, Sheaf the Langobards,</l>
				<l n="33">Hunn the Haetwere, and Holen the Wrosnan.</l>
				<l n="34">Hringwald was called the Herefaren's king.</l>
				<l n="35">Offa ruled the Angles, Alewih the Danes:</l>
				<l n="36">He was of those men the bravest,</l>
				<l n="37">however he did not achieve more valorous deeds than Offa,</l>
				<l n="38">but Offa won first of men, </l>
				<l n="39">while a youth, the greatest kingdom.</l>
				<l n="40">Not any of his contemporaries were greater in valorous deeds</l>
				<l n="41">at fighting. With his one sword </l>
				<l n="42">he defined the boundary against the Myrgings</l>
				<l n="43">by Fifeldore (the Eider estuary), held afterwards</l>
				<l n="44">by the Angles and the Swaefe as he'd won it.</l>
				<l n="45">Hrothwulf and Hrothgar held longest </l>
				<l n="46">kinship together, uncle and sister's son,</l>
				<l n="47">after they drove off the Viking tribe</l>
				<l n="48">and humbled Ingeld's vanguard,</l>
				<l n="49">and at Heorot cut to pieces the force of the Heathobards.</l>
				<l n="50">As I traversed many foreign lands</l>
				<l n="51">throughout a wide region, good and evil</l>
				<l n="52">I experienced there, deprived of my people,</l>
				<l n="53">far from generous kinsmen, and served far and wide. </l>
				<l n="54">Therefore I will sing and speak a tale, </l>
				<l n="55">Making known before the company in the mead-hall</l>
				<l n="56">how the well-born would be generous with choice gifts to me.</l>
				<l n="57">I was with the Huns and with the Ostrogoths,</l>
				<l n="58">with the Swedes and with the Geats and with the South-Danes.</l>
				<l n="59">With the Wenlas I was, and with the Varn, and with the Vikings.</l>
				<l n="60">With the Gibids I was and with the Winedas and with the Gefflegans.</l>
				<l n="61">With the Angles I was and with the Swaefe and with the Aenenas.</l>
				<l n="62">With the Saxons I was and the Sycgans and with the Suardones.</l>
				<l n="63">With the Hronan I was and the Deans and with the Heathoreamas.</l>
				<l n="64">With the Thuringians I was and with the Throwend </l>
				<l n="65">and with the Burgundians; there I received a ring;</l>
				<l n="66">there Guthhere gave a goodly treasure </l>
				<l n="67">to reward songs; that king was not stingy!</l>
				<l n="68">With the Franks I was and with the Frisians and with the Frumtings.</l>
				<l n="69">With the Rugians I was and with the Glomman and with the Romans.</l>
				<l n="70">Likewise I was in Italy with Aelfwine</l>
				<l n="71">who had of all mankind whom I have learned </l>
				<l n="72">the quickest hand to earning praise, </l>
				<l n="73">a most generous heart distributing rings</l>
				<l n="74">bright treasures, that child of Edwin!</l>
				<l n="75">With the Sercings I was and with the Serae.</l>
				<l n="76">With the Greeks I was and with the Finns and with Caesar,</l>
				<l n="77">he who ruled over many wine-burgs, </l>
				<l n="78">possessed riches and treasures and the realm of the Romans.</l>
				<l n="79">With the Irish I was and with the Picts and with the Lapps.</l>
				<l n="80">With the Lidwiccas I was and with the Leonas and with the Langobards,</l>
				<l n="81">With heathens and with heroes and with the Hundings (could heathens and heroes be puns?).</l>
				<l n="82">with the Israelites I was and with the Assyrians, </l>
				<l n="83">with the Hebrews and with the Indus and with the Egyptians.</l>
				<l n="84">WIth the Moids I was and with the Perse, and with the Myrgings</l>
				<l n="85">and the Mofdings and the Ongendmyrgings</l>
				<l n="86">and with the Amothings. With the east Thuringians I was</l>
				<l n="87">and with the Ilwan and with the Istas and Idumings. </l>
				<l n="88">And I was with Ermanric all the time,</l>
				<l n="89">There the king of the Goths was good and generous to me,</l>
				<l n="90">first among the townspeople, gave me a ring</l>
				<l n="91">in which of refined gold, the count of </l>
				<l n="92">six hundred shillings were reckoned,</l>
				<l n="93">Which I gave into the possession of Eadgils,</l>
				<l n="94">my lord protector, when I came home,</l>
				<l n="95">to my beloved lord because it was he who gave me land,</l>
				<l n="96">the king of the Myrgings, my father's inheritance.</l>
				<l n="97">And then to me Ealhhild gave a second ring, </l>
				<l n="98">the queen of the army fighting men, the daughter of Edwin. </l>
				<l n="99">Her praise stretched throughout many lands</l>
				<l n="100">when I in song must say</l>
				<l n="101">where under the sky I best knew</l>
				<l n="102">the gold-adorned queen distributing gifts.</l>
				<l n="103">Then with Scilling our clear voices</l>
				<l n="104">we raised before our victory lord</l>
				<l n="105">loudly with harp, song resounded</l>
				<l n="106">then many men of proud spirits</l>
				<l n="107">who had good knowledge spoke words</l>
				<l n="108">that they had never heard a better song.</l>
				<l n="109">Thence I traversed all the land of the Goths, </l>
				<l n="110">I sought the best battle comrades</l>
				<l n="111">that was ever the household of Ermanric.</l>
				<l n="112">Hache I sought and Beadecan and the Herelingas</l>
				<l n="113">Emerca I sought and Fridla and the East-goths,</l>
				<l n="114">wise and good, father of Unwen</l>
				<l n="115">Secca I sought and Becca, Seafola and Theodric</l>
				<l n="116">Heathoric and Sifecta, Lotherus and Incgentheow.</l>
				<l n="117">Edwin I sought and Elsa, Agelmund and Hungar,</l>
				<l n="118">and the proud company of the Withmyrgings.</l>
				<l n="119">Wulfhere I sought and Wyrmhere, very often warfare was not at rest there</l>
				<l n="120">when the Hraede army with hard swords</l>
				<l n="121">around the Wistle wood must defend</l>
				<l n="122">the ancestral lands of Attila's people.</l>
				<l n="123">Raedhere I sought and Rondhere, Rumstan and Gislaharius,</l>
				<l n="124">Withergield and Freotheric, Wudga and Hama</l>
				<l n="125">there were not the worst comrades in arms</l>
				<l n="126">Though I mention them at the last.</l>
				<l n="127">Very often from that company flew the whining</l>
				<l n="128">and shrieking spear against a hostile people.</l>
				<l n="129">Wanderers there ruled with wound gold</l>
				<l n="130">over men and women, Wudga and Hama.</l>
				<l n="131">Thus I have always found it in journeying</l>
				<l n="132">that they be dearest to their subjects</l>
				<l n="133">whom God has given the right to rule men</l>
				<l n="134">for holding while he lives here."</l>
				<l n="135">Thus are fated to wandering and roving</l>
				<l n="136">are the minstrel men throughout many regions,</l>
				<l n="137">saying at need, speaking thank-words,</l>
				<l n="138">always meeting someone south or north</l>
				<l n="139">appreciative of poems with generous gifts for those</l>
				<l n="140">who before military men will will heighten their reputation</l>
				<l n="141">to do valorous deeds until everything passes,</l>
				<l n="142">light and life together. He who works for praise </l>
				<l n="143">has under the heavens lasting glory.</l>
