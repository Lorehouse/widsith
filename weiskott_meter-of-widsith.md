**Abstract**: In a recent article in this journal, Leonard Neidorf argues for a seventh-century date for the Old English poem _Widsith_, while countenancing the possibility that one portion of the poem was compsed before the migration of the Angles and Saxons to Britan (_adventus Saxonum_). The present article disputes the possibility of a pre-_adventus_ date for this and other portions of _Widsith_. Metrical considerations tend to contradict such an exceptionally early dating, with ramifications for the categorization and interpretation of the poem as a whole. After reviewing the pertinent metricle evidence, this article argues that the available metrical for of _Widsith_ is the essential feature by which the poem, whenever and wherever it was composed, can be recognized as 'the poem' in the first place. This article concludes that _Widsith_ is not an ancient poem from a pan-Germanic distant past, but an encyclopedic Old English poem that turns inherited vocabulary to its own rhetorical purposes.
