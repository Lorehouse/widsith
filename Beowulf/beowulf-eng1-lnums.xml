     <l n="1">LO! we of the Spear-Danes', in days of yore,</l>
     <l n="2">Warrior-kings' glory have heard,</l>
     <l n="3">How the princes heroic deeds wrought.</l>
     <l n="4">Oft Scyld, son of Scef, from hosts of foes,</l>
     <l n="5">From many tribes, their mead-seats took;</l>
     <l n="6">The earl caused terror since first he was</l>
     <l n="7">Found thus forlorn: gained he comfort for that,</l>
     <l n="8">Grew under the clouds, in honors throve,</l>
     <l n="9">Until each one of those dwelling around</l>
     <l n="10">Over the whale-road, him should obey,</l>
     <l n="11">Should tribute pay: that was a good king!</l>
     <l n="12">To him was a son afterwards born,</l>
     <l n="13">Young in his palace, one whom God sent</l>
     <l n="14">To the people for comfort: their distress He perceived</l>
     <l n="15">That they ere suffered life-eating care</l>
     <l n="16">So long a while. Him therefor life's Lord,</l>
     <l n="17">King of glory, world-honor gave:</l>
     <l n="18">Beowulf was noted (wide spread his fame),</l>
     <l n="19">The son of Scyld in Scedelands.</l>
     <l n="20">So shall a young man with presents cause,</l>
     <l n="21">With rich money-gifts in his father's house.</l>
     <l n="22">That him in old age may after attend</l>
     <l n="23">Willing comrades; when war shall come,</l>
     <l n="24">May stand by their chief; by deeds of praise shall</l>
     <l n="25">In every tribe a hero thrive!</l>
     <l n="26">Then Scyld departed at the hour of fate,</l>
     <l n="27">The warlike to go into his Lord's keeping:</l>
     <l n="28">They him then bore to the ocean's wave,</l>
     <l n="29">His trusty comrades, as he himself bade,</l>
     <l n="30">Whilst with words ruled the friend of the Scyldings,</l>
     <l n="31">Beloved land-prince; long wielded he power.</l>
     <l n="32">There stood at haven with curved prow,</l>
     <l n="33">Shining and ready, the prince's ship:</l>
     <l n="34">The people laid their dear war-lord,</l>
     <l n="35">Giver of rings, on the deck of the ship,</l>
     <l n="36">The mighty by th' mast. Many treasures were there,</l>
     <l n="37">From distant lands, ornaments brought;</l>
     <l n="38">Ne'er heard I of keel more comelily filled</l>
     <l n="39">With warlike weapons and weeds of battle,</l>
     <l n="40">With bills and burnies ! On his bosom lay</l>
     <l n="41">A heap of jewels, which with him should</l>
     <l n="42">Into the flood's keeping afar depart:</l>
     <l n="43">Not at all with less gifts did they him provide,</l>
     <l n="44">With princely treasures, than those had done,</l>
     <l n="45">Who him at his birth had erst sent forth</l>
     <l n="46">Alone o'er the sea when but a child.</l>
     <l n="47">Then placed they yet a golden standard</l>
     <l n="48">High over his head, let the waves bear</l>
     <l n="49">Their gift to the sea; sad was their soul,</l>
     <l n="50">Mourning their mood. Men indeed cannot</l>
     <l n="51">Say now in sooth, hall-possessors,</l>
     <l n="52">Heroes 'neath heavens, who that heap took.</l>

     <head>I</head>
     <l n="53">Then was in the cities Beowulf, the Scyldings'</l>
     <l n="54">Beloved folk-king, for a long time</l>
     <l n="55">Renowned 'mid the nation (elsewhere went his father</l>
     <l n="56">The prince from his home), till from him after sprang</l>
     <l n="57">The great Healfdene: he ruled while he lived,</l>
     <l n="58">Agéd and warlike, kindly the Scyldings.</l>
     <l n="59">To him were four children, reckoned in order,</l>
     <l n="60">Born into the world, to the prince of the people,</l>
     <l n="61">Heorogar and Hrothgar and Halga the good.</l>
     <l n="62">I heard that Elan wife of Ongentheow was,</l>
     <l n="63">The warlike Scylfing's bed-companion.</l>
     <l n="64">Then was to Hrothgar war-speed given,</l>
     <l n="65">Honor in battle, that him his dear kinsmen</l>
     <l n="66">Gladly obeyed, until the youth grew,</l>
     <l n="67">A great band of men. It came into his mind</l>
     <l n="68">That he a great hall would then command,</l>
     <l n="69">A greater mead-hall his men to build</l>
     <l n="70">Than children of men ever had heard of,</l>
     <l n="71">And there within would he all deal out</l>
     <l n="72">To young and to old, as God him gave,</l>
     <l n="73">Except the folk-land and lives of men.</l>
     <l n="74">Then far and wide heard I the work was ordered</l>
     <l n="75">To many a tribe throughout this mid-earth</l>
     <l n="76">The folk-hall to deck. Him in time it befell</l>
     <l n="77">Quickly with men, that it was all ready,</l>
     <l n="78">The greatest of halls: Heort as name gave he it,</l>
     <l n="79">He who with his word power far and wide had.</l>
     <l n="80">He belied not his promise, bracelets he dealt,</l>
     <l n="81">Treasure at banquet. The hall arose</l>
     <l n="82">Lofty and pinnacled; hostile waves it awaited</l>
     <l n="83">Of hateful fire. Nor was it yet long</l>
     <l n="84">Before fierce hatred to the frightened men,</l>
     <l n="85">For deadly enmity, was to arise,</l>
     <l n="86">Since the fell spirit most spitefully</l>
     <l n="87">For a time endured, who in darkness abode,</l>
     <l n="88">That he on each day the sound of joy heard</l>
     <l n="89">Loud in the hall: there was harp's sound,</l>
     <l n="90">Clear song of the minstrel. He said, he who could</l>
     <l n="91">The creation of men from of old relate,</l>
     <l n="92">Quoth that the Almighty the earth had wrought,</l>
     <l n="93">The beautiful plain which water surrounds,</l>
     <l n="94">Victorious had set the sun and the moon</l>
     <l n="95">As lights for light to the land-dwellers,</l>
     <l n="96">And had adorned the regions of earth</l>
     <l n="97">With limbs and leaves, life also created</l>
     <l n="98">For every kind of living beings.</l>
     <l n="99">Thus were the warriors living in joys</l>
     <l n="100">Happily then, until one began</l>
     <l n="101">Great woes to work, a fiend of hell:</l>
     <l n="102">The wrathful spirit was Grendel named,</l>
     <l n="103">The mighty mark-stepper who the moors held,</l>
     <l n="104">Fen and fastness: the sea-fiend's abode</l>
     <l n="105">The joyless being a while in-dwelt,</l>
     <l n="106">Since the Creator him had proscribed.</l>
     <l n="107">(Upon Cain's kin that crime avenged</l>
     <l n="108">The Lord eternal, for that he slew Abel:</l>
     <l n="109">Joyed he not in that feud, but him afar banished</l>
     <l n="110">For that crime the Creator away from mankind:</l>
     <l n="111">Thence evil demons all were produced,</l>
     <l n="112">Eotens and elves and monsters of sea,</l>
     <l n="113">Such were the giants who strove against God</l>
     <l n="114">For a long time: He repaid them for that.)</l>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="115">
     <head>II</head>
     <l n="115">Then went he to seek out, after night came,</l>
     <l n="116">The high-built house, how the Ring-Danes,</l>
     <l n="117">After their beer-feast, it had arranged.</l>
     <l n="118">He found then therein a band of nobles</l>
     <l n="119">Asleep after feasting: sorrows they knew not,</l>
     <l n="120">Misfortunes of men. The demon of death,</l>
     <l n="121">Grim and greedy, soon was ready,</l>
     <l n="122">Fierce and furious, and in rest took</l>
     <l n="123">Thirty of thanes; thence back he departed,</l>
     <l n="124">Exulting in booty, homeward to go,</l>
     <l n="125">With this fill of slaughter to seek out his dwelling</l>
     <l n="126">Then at early morn was with dawn of day</l>
     <l n="127">Grendel's war-craft made known to men:</l>
     <l n="128">Then after his meal was wailing upraised,</l>
     <l n="129">A great morning-cry: the mighty prince,</l>
     <l n="130">The honored chief, sorrowful sat,</l>
     <l n="131">The strong man suffered, thane-sorrow endured,</l>
     <l n="132">After the foeman's footsteps they beheld,</l>
     <l n="133">The cursed demon's: too severe was that sorrow,</l>
     <l n="134">Loathsome and lasting. No longer time was it,</l>
     <l n="135">But after one night he again wrought</l>
     <l n="136">More deeds of murder, and did not shrink from</l>
     <l n="137">Hatred and evil: too firm he was in them.</l>
     <l n="138">Then was easy to find one who elsewhere,</l>
     <l n="139">Farther removed, rest for himself sought,</l>
     <l n="140">A bed next the chambers, since to him was shown,</l>
     <l n="141">Truly was said by a manifest sign</l>
     <l n="142">The hall-thane's hatred: he held himself after</l>
     <l n="143">Further and firmer, who 'scaped from the fiend.</l>
     <l n="144">So then he reigned and strove against right</l>
     <l n="145">Alone against all, until empty stood</l>
     <l n="146">The finest of houses. Long was the time:</l>
     <l n="147">Twelve winters' time suffering endured</l>
     <l n="148">The friend of the Scyldings, each one of woes,</l>
     <l n="149">Of sorrows extreme: therefore was this misery</l>
     <l n="150">Openly known to the children of men,</l>
     <l n="151">Sadly in songs, that Grendel contended</l>
     <l n="152">A while against Hrothgar, hateful war waged,</l>
     <l n="153">Evil and enmity many half-years,</l>
     <l n="154">Contests continual; peacefully would not</l>
     <l n="155">From any one man of the might of the Danes</l>
     <l n="156">Life-bale remove, nor with money compound;</l>
     <l n="157">No one of the wise men need there expect</l>
     <l n="158">A ransom more splendid at the murderer's hands</l>
     <l n="159">The terrible demon harassing was,</l>
     <l n="160">Dark death-shadow, the old and the young,</l>
     <l n="161">Caught and entrapped them; in constant night held</l>
     <l n="162">The misty moors: men know not indeed</l>
     <l n="163">Whither hell's demons wander in crowds.</l>
     <l n="164">So many foul deeds the foe of mankind,</l>
     <l n="165">The terrible lone one, often enacted,</l>
     <l n="166">Direful afflictions; Heorot he dwelt in.</l>
     <l n="167">The costly-decked hall, on the dark nights;</l>
     <l n="168">Yet must he not the rich gift-stool approach</l>
     <l n="169">For the Creator, nor wish for it know.</l>
     <l n="170">That was great sorrow of the friend of the Scyldings,</l>
     <l n="171">Misery of mind ! Many oft sat</l>
     <l n="172">Mighty in council; plans they devised,</l>
     <l n="173">What with bold mind then would be best</l>
     <l n="174">'Gainst the sudden attacks for them to do.</l>
     <l n="175">Sometimes they vowed at their temples of idols</l>
     <l n="176">To their gods worship, with words they prayed</l>
     <l n="177">The destroyer of spirits would render them help</l>
     <l n="178">Against their folk-sorrows. Such was their custom,</l>
     <l n="179">Hope of the heathen: hell they remembered</l>
     <l n="180">In their minds' thoughts; the Creator they knew not,</l>
     <l n="181">Judge of their deeds: the good Lord they knew not,</l>
     <l n="182">Heaven's protector could they not praise,</l>
     <l n="183">The King of glory. Woe be to him who shall,</l>
     <l n="184">Through deadly hate, thrust down his soul</l>
     <l n="185">Into the fire-abyss; for comfort he'll hope not,</l>
     <l n="186">By no means return ! Well be to him who may,</l>
     <l n="187">After his death-day, seek for the Lord,</l>
     <l n="188">In the Father's bosom mercy beseech!</l>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="189">
     <head>III</head>
     <l n="189">So then great sorrow Healfdene's son</l>
     <l n="190">Continually suffered: might not the wise chieftain</l>
     <l n="191">His woes remove: too great was that pain,</l>
     <l n="192">Loathsome and lasting, that came on the people,</l>
     <l n="193">Dreadful distress, greatest of night-bales.</l>
     <l n="194">That from home learnt Higelac's thane,</l>
     <l n="195">Good 'mong the Geats, the deeds of Grendel;</l>
     <l n="196">He was of mankind strongest in might</l>
     <l n="197">In the day then of this mortal life,</l>
     <l n="198">Noble and great. For him a ship bade he</l>
     <l n="199">A good one prepare, quoth, he the war-king</l>
     <l n="200">Over the swan-road wished to seek out,</l>
     <l n="201">The mighty prince, since he need had of men.</l>
     <l n="202">That journey to him the cunning churls</l>
     <l n="203">Not at all blamed, though he lear to them was.</l>
     <l n="204">They whetted the brave one, good omens they saw</l>
     <l n="205">The good one had of the Geats' people</l>
     <l n="206">Warriors chosen, of those whom he bravest</l>
     <l n="207">Was able to find: one of fifteen</l>
     <l n="208">The vessel he sought: a warrior made known,</l>
     <l n="209">A sea-crafty man, the neighboring landmarks.</l>
     <l n="210">Thus time went on: on the waves was the ship,</l>
     <l n="211">Boat under the mountain. The heroes ready</l>
     <l n="212">On the prow stied: the billows rolled</l>
     <l n="213">The sea 'gainst the sand. The warriors bore</l>
     <l n="214">On the deck of the ship ornaments bright,</l>
     <l n="215">Equipments ornate: the men shoved out,</l>
     <l n="216">Men on willing journey, the well-fitted wood.</l>
     <l n="217">Went then o'er the waves, by the wind hastened,</l>
     <l n="218">The foamy-necked float to a fowl most like,</l>
     <l n="219">Till at the same hour of the following day</l>
     <l n="220">The curvéd prow had traversed the water.</l>
     <l n="221">So that the sailors then saw the land,</l>
     <l n="222">The sea-cliffs shine, the mountains steep,</l>
     <l n="223">The broad sea-nesses. Then was the sea-goer</l>
     <l n="224">At the end of its voyage. Thence quickly up</l>
     <l n="225">The Weders' people on the plain stied,</l>
     <l n="226">The sea-wood tied, their battle-sarks rattled,</l>
     <l n="227">Their weeds of war: thanked they then God</l>
     <l n="228">That for them the sea-paths easy were found.</l>
     <l n="229">Then saw from the wall the guard of the Scyldings,</l>
     <l n="230">He who the sea-cliffs was set to hold,</l>
     <l n="231">Bear o'er the bulwarks bright-looking shields,</l>
     <l n="232">Weapons ready for war: wonder aroused him</l>
     <l n="233">In his mind's thoughts as to what these men were.</l>
     <l n="234">Went he then to the sea on his steed riding,</l>
     <l n="235">The thane of Hrothgar; with might he shook</l>
     <l n="236">The strong wood in his hands, with formal words spoke:</l>
     <l n="237">"What now are ye of arms-bearing men</l>
     <l n="238">With burnies protected, who thus a high keel</l>
     <l n="239">Over the sea-path bringing have come</l>
     <l n="240">O'er the waves hither, clad in helmets?</l>
     <l n="241">I was the coast-guard, sea-watch I kept</l>
     <l n="242">That no one of foes on the Danes' land</l>
     <l n="243">With a ship-army injury might do.</l>
     <l n="244">Not here more openly ever have come</l>
     <l n="245">Bearers of shields! Ye the permission</l>
     <l n="246">Of warlike men did not well know,</l>
     <l n="247">Consent of kinsmen ! Ne'er saw I a greater</l>
     <l n="248">Earl upon earth than is one of you,</l>
     <l n="249">A hero in armor: that is no home-stayer</l>
     <l n="250">With weapons adorned, unless looks belie him,</l>
     <l n="251">His peerless appearance. Now I of you shall</l>
     <l n="252">The origin learn, ere ye far hence,</l>
     <l n="253">Like to false spies, in the land of the Danes</l>
     <l n="254">Further advance. Now ye far-dwelling,</l>
     <l n="255">Sea-faring men, give willing ear</l>

     <l n="579">Weary of th' journey. Then me the sea bore,</l>
     <l n="580">The flood o'er the waves, upon the Finns' land,</l>
     <l n="581">The welling waters. Not at all about thee</l>
     <l n="582">Of such-like contests have I heard tell,</l>
     <l n="583">Of terror with swords. Breca ne'er yet</l>
     <l n="584">In battle-play, nor either of you,</l>
     <l n="585">So daring a deed ever has done,</l>
     <l n="586">With stained swords (not of that do I boast),</l>
     <l n="587">Though thou thine own brothers' murderer wast,</l>
     <l n="588">Thy blood-relations': for this shalt thou in hell</l>
     <l n="589">Curses endure, though thy wit may avail!</l>
     <l n="590">I tell thee in truth, son of Ecglaf,</l>
     <l n="591">That never had Grendel wrought so many horrors,</l>
     <l n="592">The terrible monster, to thine own prince,</l>
     <l n="593">Shame in Heorot, if thy mind were,</l>
     <l n="594">Thy temper, so fierce, as thou thyself reckonest:</l>
     <l n="595">But he hath found that he the feud need not,</l>
     <l n="596">The terrible contest of your own people,</l>
     <l n="597">Very much dread, of the Victor-Scyldings;</l>
     <l n="598">He taketh forced pledge, he spareth no one</l>
     <l n="599">Of the Danes' people, but he joy beareth,</l>
     <l n="600">Killeth and eateth, nor weeneth of contest</l>
     <l n="601">With the Spear-Danes. But I to him shall</l>
     <l n="602">The Geats' strength and might without delay now</l>
     <l n="603">Offer in battle. Then shall go he who may</l>
     <l n="604">Proudly to mead, when morning-light</l>
     <l n="605">Of the second day o'er the children of men,</l>
     <l n="606">The sun ether-clad, shall shine from the South."</l>
     <l n="607">Then was in joy the giver of treasure,</l>
     <l n="608">Gray-haired and war-fierce; help he expected,</l>
     <l n="609">The ruler of Bright-Danes; in Beowulf heard</l>
     <l n="610">The people's shepherd the firm-set purpose.</l>
     <l n="611">There was laughter of heroes, the harp merry sounded,</l>
     <l n="612">Winsome were words. Went Wealhtheow forth,</l>
     <l n="613">The queen of Hrothgar, mindful of courtesies,</l>
     <l n="614">Gold-adorned greeted the men in the hall,</l>
     <l n="615">And the high-born woman then gave the cup</l>
     <l n="616">First to the East-Danes' home-protector,</l>
     <l n="617">Bade him be blithe at the beer-drinking,</l>
     <l n="618">Him dear to his people. In joy he received</l>
     <l n="619">The food and the hall-cup, victorious king.</l>
     <l n="620">Then around went the Helmings' lady</l>
     <l n="621">To every division of old and of young,</l>
     <l n="622">Costly gifts gave, until the time came</l>
     <l n="623">That she to Beowulf, the ring-adorned queen,</l>
     <l n="624">Noble in mind, the mead-cup bore:</l>
     <l n="625">She greeted the Geats' chief, thanks gave to God,</l>
     <l n="626">Wise in her words, that the wish to her fell,</l>
     <l n="627">That on any earl she might rely</l>
     <l n="628">For comfort in evils. Received he the cup,</l>
     <l n="629">The warrior fierce, at Wealhtheow's hands.</l>
     <l n="630">And then he spoke, ready for battle;</l>
     <l n="631">Beowulf spoke, Ecgtheow's son:</l>
     <l n="632">"This thought I then, when I on the sea stied,</l>
     <l n="633">Boarded my sea-boat with my warrior-band,</l>
     <l n="634">That I throughout of your own people</l>
     <l n="635">The will would work, or in battle fall,</l>
     <l n="636">Fast in fiend's grip. I shall perform</l>
     <l n="637">Deeds of valor, or end-day mine</l>
     <l n="638">In this mead-hall I shall await."</l>
     <l n="639">To the woman these words well-pleasing were,</l>
     <l n="640">Boasts of the Geat: gold-adorned went</l>
     <l n="641">The high-born queen to sit by her lord.</l>
     <l n="642">Then was as before again in the hall</l>
     <l n="643">Mighty word spoken, in joy were the people,</l>
     <l n="644">The victor-folk's shout, until all at once</l>
     <l n="645">The son of Healfdene wished to seek out</l>
     <l n="646">His evening-rest; he knew for the monster</l>
     <l n="647">In the high hall was battle prepared,</l>
     <l n="648">647a [Because in this hall the Ring-Danes never</l>
     <l n="649">647bDared to abide unless by day-time],</l>
     <l n="650">From the time that they the sun-light might see,</l>
     <l n="651">Till night spreading darkness over all things,</l>
     <l n="652">Night-wandering spirits, came advancing</l>
     <l n="653">Dark under the clouds. The crowd all arose:</l>
     <l n="654">Greeted then glad-minded one man another,</l>
     <l n="655">Hrothgar Beowulf, and offered him hail,</l>
     <l n="656">Power o'er the mead-hall, and this word spoke:</l>
     <l n="657">" Never to any man ere did I trust,</l>
     <l n="658">Since I could lift my hand and my shield,</l>
     <l n="659">Royal hall of the Danes except to thee now.</l>
     <l n="660">Have now and hold the noblest of houses,</l>
     <l n="661">Of glory be mindful, a hero's might show,</l>
     <l n="662">Watch 'gainst the foe. No wish shalt thou want,</l>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="662">
     <head>X</head>
     <l n="664">Then Hrothgar went with his warrior-band,</l>
     <l n="665">The prince of the Scyldings, out of the hall:</l>
     <l n="666">The war-prince would Wealhtheow seek,</l>
     <l n="667">His queen as companion. The glory of kings</l>
     <l n="668">Grendel against, as men heard say,</l>
     <l n="669">A hall-guard had set: he performed special service</l>
     <l n="670">For the prince of the Danes, he eoten-guard kept.</l>
     <l n="671">Now the prince of the Geats earnestly trusted</l>
     <l n="672">In his proud might, in the Creator's favor.</l>
     <l n="673">Then he laid him aside his iron burnie,</l>
     <l n="674">Helmet from head, his jewelled sword gave,</l>
     <l n="675">Choicest of weapons, to his servant-thane,</l>
     <l n="676">And bade him keep his armor of war.</l>
     <l n="677">Then spoke the hero some boastful words,</l>
     <l n="678">Beowulf the Geat, ere he on bed stied:</l>
     <l n="679">"I count not myself less good in war-might</l>
     <l n="680">For deeds of battle than Grendel himself:</l>
     <l n="681">Therefore with my sword I him will not kill,</l>
     <l n="682">Of life deprive, though I it all may.</l>
     <l n="683">He knows not these goods, so that he me may slay</l>
     <l n="684">Hew down my shield, although he be fierce</l>
     <l n="685">In hostile deeds: but we at night shall</l>
     <l n="686">From swords refrain, if he dare to seek</l>
     <l n="687">War without weapons; and then the wise God,</l>
     <l n="688">The holy Lord, on whatever hand</l>
     <l n="689">May the glory adjudge, as seems to Him fit."</l>
     <l n="690">Then lay down the warlike: the pillow received</l>
     <l n="691">The cheeks of the earl, and him around many</l>
     <l n="692">A valiant sea-warrior sought his hall-rest.</l>
     <l n="693">No one of these thought that thence he should</l>
     <l n="694">Again his dear home ever seek out,</l>
     <l n="695">Folk or free-city where he was reared;</l>
     <l n="696">But they had heard that too many before</l>
     <l n="697">In this wine-hall bloody death carried off</l>
     <l n="698">Of the folk of the Danes. But to them the Lord gave</l>
     <l n="699">The web of war-speed, to the folk of the Weders</l>
     <l n="700">Comfort and help, so that they their foes</l>
     <l n="701">Through the craft of one all overcame,</l>
     <l n="702">By the might of one self: the truth is made known</l>
     <l n="703">That the mighty God the race of man</l>
     <l n="704">Has always ruled. - Came in wan night</l>
     <l n="705">The shadow-goer stepping. The warriors slept,</l>

     <l n="707">All except one. That was to men known,</l>
     <l n="708">That them he might not, whom the Creator would not,</l>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="710">
     <head>XI</head>
     <l n="712">Then came from the moor 'neath the misty slopes</l>
     <l n="713">Grendel going, God's anger he bore.</l>
     <l n="714">The wicked foe thought of the race of man</l>
     <l n="715">Some one to entrap in that high hall:</l>
     <l n="716">He went 'neath the clouds whither he the wine-hall,</l>
     <l n="717">The gold-hall of men, most thoroughly knew,</l>
     <l n="718">Shining with gold-plates: that was not the first time</l>
     <l n="719">That he of Hrothgar the home had sought.</l>
     <l n="720">Ne'er in his life-time before nor after</l>
     <l n="721">Bolder warriors, hall-thanes, did he find!</l>
     <l n="722">Then came to the hall the being approaching,</l>
     <l n="723">Of joys deprived. The door soon sprang open</l>
     <l n="724">Fast in its fire-bands, when he with hands touched it;</l>
     <l n="725">Then burst the bale-bringer, since he was enraged,</l>
     <l n="726">The door of the hall. Soon after that</l>
     <l n="727">On the many-colored floor the fiendish one trod,</l>
     <l n="728">Mad in mind went: from his eyes stood</l>
     <l n="729">A loathsome light likest to flame.</l>
     <l n="730">He saw in the hall many of warriors.</l>
     <l n="731">A band in peace sleeping all together,</l>
     <l n="732">A heap of kin-warriors. Then laughed his mood</l>
     <l n="733">He thought that he would, ere day came, divide,</l>
     <l n="734">The terrible monster, of every one</l>
     <l n="735">The life from the body, since to him was fallen</l>
     <l n="736">A hope of much food. That no longer was fitted.</l>
     <l n="737">That he might more of the race of man</l>
     <l n="738">Devour by night. The strong-in-might saw,</l>
     <l n="739">The kinsman of Hygelac, how the fell foe</l>
     <l n="740">With his swift attacks was going to act.</l>
     <l n="741">That did not the monster think to delay,</l>
     <l n="742">But quickly he seized for the first time</l>
     <l n="743">A sleeping warrior, him tore unresisting,</l>
     <l n="744">Bit his bone-frame, drank blood from his veins,</l>
     <l n="745">In great bites him swallowed: soon then he had,</l>
     <l n="746">Deprived of life, him all devoured,</l>
     <l n="747">Feet even and hands. Forth nearer he stepped,</l>
     <l n="748">Seized then with his hands the firm-in-mind</l>
     <l n="749">Warrior at rest. Him reached out agaist</l>
     <l n="750">The fiend with his hand: quickly he seized</l>
     <l n="751">The cunning-in-mind and on his arm sat.</l>
     <l n="752">Soon this perceived the worker of evil,</l>
     <l n="753">That he never found in this mid-earth,</l>
     <l n="754">In the regions of earth, in another man</l>
     <l n="755">A greater hand-grip: in mood he became</l>
     <l n="756">In his soul frightened; he could not sooner forth.</l>
     <l n="757">His mind was death-ready; into darkness would flee,</l>
     <l n="758">The devil-band seek: his course was not there,</l>
     <l n="759">As he in old-days before had found.</l>
     <l n="760">Remembered he then, good kinsman of Hygelac,</l>
     <l n="761">His evening-speech; upright he stood</l>
     <l n="762">And him fast seized: his fingers cracked</l>
     <l n="763">The eoten would outwards: the earl further stepped;</l>
     <l n="764">The mighty one thought, whereso he might,</l>
     <l n="765">Afar to escape, and away thence</l>
     <l n="766">Flee into the marshes: he knew that his fingers</l>
     <l n="767">Were in his foe's grip: that was a bad journey</l>
     <l n="768">That the harm-bringing foe had taken to Heorot:</l>
     <l n="769">The royal hall sounded: for all the Danes was,</l>
     <l n="770">The city-dwellers, each one of the bold,</l>
     <l n="771">For earls the ale spilt. Angry were both</l>
     <l n="772">Furious contestants: the hall cracked aloud:</l>
     <l n="773">Then was it great wonder that the wine-hall</l>
     <l n="774">Withstood the fierce fighters, that it to ground fell not,</l>
     <l n="775">The fair folk-hall: but it was too fast</l>
     <l n="776">Within and without in its iron bands</l>
     <l n="777">By cunning skill forged. There from the sill fell</l>
     <l n="778">Many a mead-bench, as I have heard say,</l>
     <l n="779">Adorned with gold, where the foes fought.</l>
     <l n="780">Of this before weened not wise men of the Scyldings</l>
     <l n="781">That it ever with strength any of men,</l>
     <l n="782">Goodly and bone-adorned, to pieces might break,</l>
     <l n="783">With craft destroy, unless flame's embrace</l>
     <l n="784">In smoke should it swallow. The sound arose</l>
     <l n="785">Often repeated: to the North-Danes stood</l>
     <l n="786">Fearful terror, to every one</l>
     <l n="787">Of those who from the wall the weeping heard,</l>
     <l n="788">The terrible song sung of th' opposer of God,</l>
     <l n="789">The joyless song, his pain lament</l>
     <l n="790">The prisoner of hell. He held him too fast,</l>
     <l n="791">He who of men was strongest in might</l>

     <l n="795">Nor his life-days to any people</l>

     <l n="811">Then that he perceived, he who oft before</l>
     <l n="812">In mirth of mind against mankind</l>

     <l n="818">The terrible monster: there was on his shoulder</l>
     <l n="819">An evident wound; apart sprang the sinews,</l>
     <l n="820">The bone-frame burst. To Beowulf was</l>
     <l n="821">Battle-fame given: Grendel should thence</l>
     <l n="822">Sick-of-life flee under the fen-slopes,</l>
     <l n="823">Seek his joyless abode; too surely he knew</l>

     <l n="826">By the bloody strife was the wish fulfilled;</l>

     <l n="839">Then was in the morning, as I have heard say,</l>
     <l n="840">Around the gift-hall many a warrior:</l>
     <l n="841">The people's leaders from far and near came</l>
     <l n="842">Through the wide ways the wonder to view,</l>
     <l n="843">The tracks of the foe. Ne'er did his life-severing</l>
     <l n="844">Sorrowful seem to any of men,</l>
     <l n="845">Of those who then viewed the track of the vanquished,</l>

     <l n="847">In fight overcome, to the mere of the nickers,</l>
     <l n="848">Doomed and driven, his life-tracks bore.</l>
     <l n="849">There was the surface welling in blood;</l>
     <l n="850">The frightful waves' lashing all commingled</l>
     <l n="851">Hot in gore boiled with the sword-blood ;</l>
     <l n="852">The doomed-to-death dyed them, when of joys deprived</l>
     <l n="853">In his fen-refuge he laid down his life,</l>
     <l n="854">His heathen soul, where hell him received.</l>
     <l n="855">Thence back again came the old companions,</l>
     <l n="856">And many a young one from their glad course,</l>
     <l n="857">From the sea proudly riding on horses,</l>
     <l n="858">Heroes on steeds. There then was Beowulf's</l>
     <l n="859">Glory proclaimed : oft many said</l>

     <l n="864">They did not now at all their dear lord blame,</l>
     <l n="865">The friendly Hrothgar, but that was a good king.</l>
     <l n="866">Sometimes the battle-famed permitted to leap,</l>
     <l n="867">In contest to go, their yellow horses</l>
     <l n="868">Where the land-roads seemed to them fair,</l>
     <l n="869">Known for their goodness. Sometimes a king's thane,</l>
     <l n="870">A man renowned, mindful of songs,</l>
     <l n="871">He who very many of old-time sagas,</l>
     <l n="872">A great number remembered, framed other words</l>
     <l n="873">Rightly connected: the scope then began</l>
     <l n="874">Beowulf's exploit with skill to tell,</l>
     <l n="875">And with art to relate well-composed tales,</l>
     <l n="876">Words to exchange; he told everything</l>
     <l n="877">That he of Sigemund had heard men say,</l>
     <l n="878">His noble deeds, much of the unknown,</l>
     <l n="879">The Waelsing's contest, his journeys wide,</l>
     <l n="880">Which the children of men did not well know,</l>
     <l n="881">The feuds and crimes, but Fitela with him,</l>
     <l n="882">When he some such thing wished to relate,</l>
     <l n="883">Uncle to nephew, as they ever were</l>
     <l n="884">In every fight comrades in need:</l>
     <l n="885">They had very many of the race of the eotens</l>
     <l n="886">Slain with their swords. To Sigemund came</l>
     <l n="887">After his death-day no little fame</l>
     <l n="888">Since he, brave in war, destroyed the dragon,</l>
     <l n="889">The guard of the hoard: he 'neath the gray stone,</l>
     <l n="890">The prince's son, had risked alone</l>
     <l n="891">The very bold deed; not with him was Fitela;</l>
     <l n="892">Yet it happened to him that the sword pierced</l>
     <l n="893">through</l>
     <l n="894">The wonderful worm, that it in the wall stood,</l>
     <l n="895">The lordly weapon; in death lay the dragon.</l>
     <l n="896">The terrible one in strength had prevailed,</l>
     <l n="897">So that he the ring-hoard himself might enjoy</l>
     <l n="898">At his own will; he loaded his vessel,</l>
     <l n="899">Bore on the ship's bosom the ornaments bright,</l>
     <l n="900">The son of Waels; the worm's heat melted him.</l>
     <l n="901">He was of exiles the greatest by far</l>
     <l n="902">Among the nations, the warriors' defence</l>
     <l n="903">In noble deeds; for that ere had he glory.</l>
     <l n="904">After of IIeremod the battle-might failed.</l>
     <l n="905">His strength and prowess, he was 'mong the Jutes</l>
     <l n="906">Into his foe's power forthwith betrayed,</l>
     <l n="907">Sent away quickly: him waves of sorrow</l>
     <l n="908">Too long oppressed; he was to his people,</l>
     <l n="909">To all of his princes, a life-long distress:</l>
     <l n="910">Likewise oft lamented in former times</l>
     <l n="911">The brave one's journey many a wise churl,</l>
     <l n="912">Who trusted in him for help in misfortunes,</l>
     <l n="913">That the son of their prince was to grow up,</l>
     <l n="914">Take the place of his father, his people possess,</l>
     <l n="915">Hoard and head-city, kingdom of heroes,</l>
     <l n="916">Home of the Scyldings. He was there to all,</l>
     <l n="917">The kinsman of Hygelac, to the race of man,</l>
     <l n="918">To friends more beloved: him sorrow befell.-</l>

     <l n="920">With their horses they measured. Then was morning-light</l>
     <l n="921">Advanced and hastened: many a man went,</l>
     <l n="922">Brave now in mind, to the high hall</l>
     <l n="923">To see the rare wonder; the king himself also</l>
     <l n="924">From his bridal chamber, guardian of treasures,</l>
     <l n="925">Stepped strong in glory with a great crowd,</l>
     <l n="926">Famed for his virtues, and his queen with him</l>

     <l n="928">Hrothgar then spoke (he went to the hall,</l>
     <l n="929">Stood by the column, looked at the high roof</l>
     <l n="930">Adorned with gold and at Grendel's hand):</l>
     <l n="931">" For this glad sight thanks to the Almighty</l>
     <l n="932">Quickly be given! Much evil I suffered,</l>
     <l n="933">Sorrows from Grendel: God may ever work</l>
     <l n="934">Wonder on wonder, King of glory.</l>
     <l n="935">Lately it was that I for myself</l>
     <l n="936">Of any of woes weened not my life long</l>
     <l n="937">Relief to obtain, since stained with blood</l>
     <l n="938">The noblest of houses drenched in gore stood;</l>
     <l n="939">Woe was brought down on every wise man,</l>
     <l n="940">Of those who weened not that they in their lives</l>
     <l n="941">The people's land-work from foes might defend,</l>
     <l n="942">From demons and devils. Now hath a hero,</l>
     <l n="943">Through the Lord's might, a deed performed,</l>
     <l n="944">Which we all before were not at all able</l>
     <l n="945">With wisdom to work. Lo! this may say</l>
     <l n="946">Even whatever woman brought forth this son</l>
     <l n="947">After man's nature, if she yet liveth,</l>
     <l n="948">That to her the eternal Creator was gracious</l>
     <l n="949">In her child-bearing. Now I thee, Beowulf,</l>

     <l n="951">Will love in lite : keep well henceforth</l>
     <l n="952">The kinship new. To thee shall no lack be</l>
     <l n="953">Of earthly wishes o'er which I have power.</l>
     <l n="954">Very often for less have I fixed the reward,</l>
     <l n="955">The share of the treasure, to warrior less brave,</l>
     <l n="956">One worse in the fight. Thou hast for thyself</l>
     <l n="957">Effected by deeds that thy fame shall live</l>
     <l n="958">For ever and ever. May thee the Almighty</l>
     <l n="959">With good repay, as He heretofore did !"</l>
     <l n="960">Beowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:</l>
     <l n="961">"That deed of might we, with great good-will,</l>
     <l n="962">That fight have fought, boldly encountered</l>
     <l n="963">The strength of the unknown: I rather would wish</l>
     <l n="964">That thou himself now mightest see,</l>
     <l n="965">The foe in his battle-dress wearied to death.</l>
     <l n="966">I quickly him with hardest grips</l>
     <l n="967">Thought then to bind on the death-bed,</l>
     <l n="968">That he by hand-grip of mine should lie</l>
     <l n="969">Striving for life, if his body escaped not:</l>
     <l n="970">I might not him, since the Creator willed not,</l>
     <l n="971">Cut off from escape: not so firm held I him,</l>
     <l n="972">The life-destroyer: too powerful was he,</l>
     <l n="973">The foe in his speed. Yet his hand did he let</l>
     <l n="974">For life-protection remain behind,</l>
     <l n="975">His arm and shoulder: not there, however,</l>
     <l n="976">Did the helpless man gain any comfort.</l>
     <l n="977">Not longer shall live the evil-doer</l>
     <l n="978">Burdened with sins, but him sore pain</l>
     <l n="979">In his strong grip sternly has seized,</l>
     <l n="980">In his bonds of bale: there shall abide</l>
     <l n="981">The sin-stained man the mickle doom,</l>
     <l n="982">How the glorious Creator to him will prescribe."</l>
     <l n="983">Then was more silent the son of Ecglaf</l>
     <l n="984">In his boasting-speech of warlike deeds,</l>
     <l n="985">After the princes, by the earl's might,</l>
     <l n="986">Upon the high roof the hand had viewed,</l>
     <l n="987">The foe-man's fingers, each one before him:</l>
     <l n="988">Each place of the nails was likest to steel,</l>
     <l n="989">The heathen's hand-spurs, the battle-monster's</l>
     <l n="990">Horrible claw: each one then said</l>
     <l n="991">That him would touch of warlike men</l>
     <l n="992">No excellent weapon, so that the demon's</l>
     <l n="993">Bloody war-hand it would break off.</l>

     <head>XV</head>
     <l n="994">Then quickly was ordered Heorot within</l>
     <l n="995">By hands to adorn: there were many of those,</l>
     <l n="996">Of men and of women, who that wine-hall,</l>
     <l n="997">That guest-room prepared. Gold-adorned shone</l>
     <l n="998">The webs on the walls, many wondrous sights</l>
     <l n="999">To each one of men, who on such look.</l>
     <l n="1000">That building bright was very much injured,</l>
     <l n="1001">All the interior in its iron-bands fast;</l>
     <l n="1002">The hinges were shivered; the roof alone saved</l>
     <l n="1003">Entirely sound, when had the monster,</l>
     <l n="1004">Condemned for his crimes, in flight escaped,</l>
     <l n="1005">Hopeless of life. It will not be easy</l>
     <l n="1006">Fate to escape, let do it who will;</l>
     <l n="1007">But each shall obtain of soul-bearing men,</l>

     <l n="1012">That to the hall went Healfdene's son,</l>
     <l n="1013">The king himself the feast would enjoy.</l>
     <l n="1014">Ne'er heard I that folk in greater crowd</l>
     <l n="1015">Around their ring-giver better behaved.</l>
     <l n="1016">Went then to the benches the heroes renowned</l>
     <l n="1017">Rejoiced at the plenty: courteously shared</l>
     <l n="1018">Many a mead-cup the kinsmen of these,</l>
     <l n="1019">The bold-minded ones in the high hall,</l>
     <l n="1020">Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot within</l>
     <l n="1021">Was filled with friends: not at all deeds of guile</l>
     <l n="1022">Did the Folk-Scyldings at this time prepare.</l>
     <l n="1023">Gave then to Beowulf Healfdene's son</l>
     <l n="1024">A golden banner as victory's reward,</l>
     <l n="1025">A wreathed standard, helmet and burnie;</l>
     <l n="1026">A great jewelled sword many then saw</l>
     <l n="1027">Before the chief borne. Beowulf received</l>

     <l n="1029">Before the warriors need he be ashamed:</l>
     <l n="1030">Ne'er heard I, more courteously, that treasures four</l>
     <l n="1031">With gold adorned, many of men</l>
     <l n="1032">On the ale-bench to each other gave.</l>
     <l n="1033">'Round the crown of the helmet head-protection</l>
     <l n="1034">A loss wound with wires was keeping without,</l>
     <l n="1035">That him the battle-swords boldly might not,</l>
     <l n="1036">By file hardened, injure, when the shield-warrior</l>
     <l n="1037">Against his foes in battle should go.</l>
     <l n="1038">The earl's defence eight horses ordered,</l>
     <l n="1039">With golden trappings, to lead in the hall</l>
     <l n="1040">In under the barriers: on one of these stood</l>
     <l n="1041">A saddle art-decked, with treasure adorned;</l>
     <l n="1042">That was the battle-seat of the high king,</l>
     <l n="1043">When in sword-play Healfdene's son</l>

     <l n="1049">So like a man the noble prince,</l>

     <l n="1055">On the mead-bench a treasure bestowed.</l>
     <l n="1056">A sword as an heir-loom, and bade for that one</l>
     <l n="1057">To pay with gold, whom Grendel before</l>

     <l n="1068">The harp was played, the song oft rehearsed,</l>

     <l n="1070">Along the mead-bench was to make known:</l>

     <l n="1074">Then indeed Hildeburh needed not praise</l>
     <l n="1075">The faith of the Jutes: guiltless was she</l>
     <l n="1076">Deprived of her dear ones in the shield-play,</l>
     <l n="1077">Of sons and of brothers: by fate they fell</l>
     <l n="1078">Wounded with spear: that was a sad woman.</l>
     <l n="1079">Not without reason did the daughter of Hoc</l>
     <l n="1080">Lament fate's decree, when morning came,</l>
     <l n="1081">When she under heaven might then behold</l>
     <l n="1082">The death-bale of kinsmen, where she before had</l>
     <l n="1083">Most worldly joy. War took away all</l>
     <l n="1084">The thanes of Finn except a few only,</l>

     <l n="1088">From the chief's thane : but they offered them terms,</l>
     <l n="1089">That they for them other hall would provide,</l>
     <l n="1090">Hall and high seat, that they power of half</l>
     <l n="1091">With the Jutes' sons were to possess,</l>

     <l n="1096">Of plated gold, as he the Frisians</l>
     <l n="1097">In the beer-hall would encourage.</l>
     <l n="1098">Then they confirmed on either side</l>
     <l n="1099">A firm peace-compact: Finn to Hengest,</l>
     <l n="1100">In valor invincible, promised with oaths</l>
     <l n="1101">That he the remnant, by the doom of his wise men,</l>
     <l n="1102">In honor would hold, that no man there</l>
     <l n="1103">By words nor works the compact should break,</l>

     <l n="1109">Then the edge of the sword it should avenge.</l>
     <l n="1110">The oath was confirmed and treasure of gold</l>
     <l n="1111">From the hoard taken. Of the warlike Scyldings</l>

     <l n="1134">The ring-prowed ship: in storm rolled the ocean,</l>

     <l n="1170">That he great courage had, tho' to his kinsmen he was not</l>
     <l n="1171">Honest in play of the swords. Spoke then the queen of the Scyldings:</l>

     <l n="1173">Giver of treasure. Be thou in health,</l>
     <l n="1174">Gold-friend of men, and to the Geats speak</l>
     <l n="1175">With mildest words, as a man shall do.</l>
     <l n="1176">Be to the Geats kind, mindful of gifts;</l>
     <l n="1177">Near and afar hast thou now peace.</l>
     <l n="1178">One said to me thou for a son would</l>

     <l n="1182">Folk and kingdom, when thou shalt forth</l>
     <l n="1183">Fate's decree see. I know well indeed</l>
     <l n="1184">My friendly Hrothulf, that he the youth will</l>
     <l n="1185">In honor hold, if thou sooner than he,</l>
     <l n="1186">Friend of the Scyldings, leavest the world:</l>
     <l n="1187">I ween that he with good will repay</l>
     <l n="1188">Our own children, if he all remember,</l>
     <l n="1189">What we, through good-will and also through honor,</l>
     <l n="1190">Of kindnesses showed to him when a child."</l>
     <l n="1191">Turned she then to the bench where were her sons,</l>
     <l n="1192">Hrethric and Hrothmund, and the warriors' children</l>
     <l n="1193">The youth together, where sat the good</l>

     <l n="1254">They went then to sleep: one sorely paid for</l>

     <l n="1256">When the gold-hall Grendel in-dwelt,</l>
     <l n="1257">Evil deeds wrought, until the end came,</l>
     <l n="1258">Death for his crimes. That became plain,</l>
     <l n="1259">To men widely known, that still an avenger</l>
     <l n="1260">Lived for his foes. For a long time</l>
     <l n="1261">After the war-sorrow Grendel's mother,</l>
     <l n="1262">A terrible woman, nourished her grief,</l>
     <l n="1263">Who was said to inhabit the fearful waters,</l>
     <l n="1264">The ice-cold streams, since Cain became</l>
     <l n="1265">The murderer by sword of his only brother,</l>
     <l n="1266">His father's son; then outlawed he went,</l>
     <l n="1267">With murder marked, to flee human joy,</l>
     <l n="1268">Dwelt in the waste. Thence many sprang</l>
     <l n="1269">Of the demons of fate; of these one was Grendel,</l>
     <l n="1270">Hateful and ravenous, who in Heorot found</l>
     <l n="1271">A watching man awaiting the battle</l>
     <l n="1272">Where the fell monster him was attacking:</l>
     <l n="1273">Yet he remembered the strength of his might,</l>
     <l n="1274">The powerful gift, which God to him gave,</l>
     <l n="1275">And on the Lord's favor relied for himself</l>
     <l n="1276">For comfort and help: so the fiend overcame he,</l>
     <l n="1277">Felled the demon of hell, when he humbled departed,</l>
     <l n="1278">Deprived of joy, his death-place to see,</l>
     <l n="1279">The foe of mankind. And still his mother,</l>
     <l n="1280">Greedy and raging, wished then to go</l>
     <l n="1281">The sorrowful journey her son to avenge.</l>
     <l n="1282">She came then to Heorot, where the Ring-Danes</l>
     <l n="1283">Through the hall slept: then there was soon</l>
     <l n="1284">A change to the earls, when within entered</l>
     <l n="1285">Grendel's-mother. The terror was less</l>
     <l n="1286">Even by so much as is woman's strength,</l>
     <l n="1287">A woman's war-terror, esteemed by a man,</l>
     <l n="1288">When a bound sword, forged by the hammer,</l>
     <l n="1289">The sword stained with gore, the boar on the helmet,</l>
     <l n="1290">Strong in its edges, opposite cleaves.</l>
     <l n="1291">Then was in the hall the hard-edged drawn,</l>
     <l n="1292">The sword o'er the seats, many a broad shield</l>
     <l n="1293">Raised firm in hand: of helmet one thought not,</l>
     <l n="1294">Of burnie broad, when terror him seized.</l>
     <l n="1295">She was in haste, would thence away,</l>
     <l n="1296">Her life preserve, when she was discovered.</l>
     <l n="1297">Quickly had she of one of the warriors</l>
     <l n="1298">Firmly laid hold, when she to fen went:</l>
     <l n="1299">He was to Hrothgar, the dearest of men</l>
     <l n="1300">In the office of comrade by the two seas,</l>
     <l n="1301">A shield-warrior strong, whom she in rest killed,</l>
     <l n="1302">A hero renowned. Not there was Beowulf,</l>
     <l n="1303">But other room before was assigned,</l>
     <l n="1304">After the treasure-giving, to the great Geat.</l>
     <l n="1305">Noise was in Heorot: she in its gore took</l>
     <l n="1306">The well-known hand. Grief was renewed</l>
     <l n="1307">Again in the dwellings; 'twas not a good trade,</l>
     <l n="1308">That they on both sides payment should make</l>
     <l n="1309">With the lives of their friends. Then was the old king,</l>
     <l n="1310">The hoary warrior, in sorrowful mood,</l>
     <l n="1311">When he his chief thane, deprived of life,</l>
     <l n="1312">The dearest one, knew to be dead.</l>
     <l n="1313">Quickly was Beowulf brought to the hall,</l>
     <l n="1314">The victory-blest hero. At dawn of day</l>
     <l n="1315">Went one of earls, the noble warrior,</l>
     <l n="1316">Himself with his comrades, where the wise one</l>
     <l n="1317">awaited,</l>
     <l n="1318">Whether for him the Almighty will ever,</l>
     <l n="1319">After this woe-spell, a change of things work.</l>
     <l n="1320">Went then on the floor the man war-renowned</l>
     <l n="1321">With his band of men (the hall-wood resounded),</l>
     <l n="1322">Until he addressed the wise one in words,</l>

     <l n="1339">In a powerful way by your hard grips,</l>
     <l n="1340">Because he too long my own people</l>

     <l n="1403">Then was for Hrothgar a horse provided,</l>
     <l n="1404">A steed with curled mane: the ruler wise</l>
     <l n="1405">Well-equipped went; the band stepped forth</l>
     <l n="1406">Of bearers of shields. The foot-tracks were</l>
     <l n="1407">On the forest-paths widely perceived,</l>

     <l n="1432">As at mid-day often prepare</l>
     <l n="1433">A sorrowful voyage on the sail-road,</l>
     <l n="1434">Worms and wild beasts: rushed they away</l>
     <l n="1435">Fierce and angry; the noise they perceived</l>
     <l n="1436">The war-horn sound. The prince of the Geats</l>
     <l n="1437">With his arrowed bow deprived one of life,</l>

     <l n="1441">Quickly was in the waves with their boar-spears,</l>

     <l n="1443">Pressed after with struggles and to the ness drawn,</l>
     <l n="1444">The wonderful monster: the men looked upon</l>

     <l n="1454">Adorned with treasure seek the sea-waves,</l>
     <l n="1455">Encircled with diadem, as in days of old</l>
     <l n="1456">The weapon-smith wrought it, wondrously framed it</l>
     <l n="1457">Set with swine-bodies, so that it never after</l>
     <l n="1458">The flaming war-swords might be able to bite.</l>
     <l n="1459">That was not then the least of strong helps,</l>
     <l n="1460">That to him in need Hrothgar's orator lent:</l>
     <l n="1461">Of that hilted sword Hrunting was name;</l>
     <l n="1462">That was a chief one of old-time treasures;</l>
     <l n="1463">Its edge was of iron, with poison-twigs stained,</l>
     <l n="1464">Hardened with battle-gore; ne'er failed it in fight</l>
     <l n="1465">Any of men, who it wielded with hand,</l>
     <l n="1466">He who durst tread the terrible paths,</l>
     <l n="1467">The folk-place of foes: that was not the first time,</l>
     <l n="1468">That deeds of valor it should perform.</l>
     <l n="1469">The kinsman of Ecglaf remembered not now,</l>
     <l n="1470">Mighty in strength, what he before spoke</l>
     <l n="1471">Drunken with wine, when the weapon he lent</l>
     <l n="1472">To a better sword-bearer; he himself durst not</l>
     <l n="1473">Under waves' tumult venture his life,</l>
     <l n="1474">Heroic deeds work; there he lost fame,</l>
     <l n="1475">A name for valor; not so with the other,</l>
     <l n="1476">When he for battle himself had prepared.</l>

     <l n="1477">Beowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:</l>
     <l n="1478">"Bethink thyself now, great kinsman of Healfdene</l>
     <l n="1479">Thou ruler wise, now I'm for the way ready,</l>
     <l n="1480">Gold-friend of men, of what we once spoke,</l>
     <l n="1481">If I in thy service should at any time</l>
     <l n="1482">Of my life be deprived, that thou wouldst ever be</l>
     <l n="1483">To me when gone hence, in stead of a father.</l>
     <l n="1484">Be thou a protector to my knightly thanes,</l>
     <l n="1485">My trusty comrades, if war take me off:</l>
     <l n="1486">Also the treasures, which thou gavest me,</l>
     <l n="1487">Do thou, dear Hrothgar, to Hygelac send.</l>
     <l n="1488">May then by the gold the Geat's lord perceive,</l>
     <l n="1489">Hrethel's son see, when he looks on the treasure,</l>
     <l n="1490">That I did one find in man's virtues good,</l>
     <l n="1491">A giver of rings, him enjoyed while I might.</l>
     <l n="1492">And do thou let Hunferth the ancient relic,</l>
     <l n="1493">The wonderful sword, the widely-known man</l>
     <l n="1494">The hard-edged have. I shall with Hrunting</l>
     <l n="1495">Fame for me gain, or death will me take."</l>
     <l n="1496">After these words the prince of the Weder-Geats</l>
     <l n="1497">Hastened with valor, not for an answer</l>
     <l n="1498">Would he await. The water-flood took</l>
     <l n="1499">The mighty warrior: then was a day's space</l>
     <l n="1500">Ere the bottom-plain he might perceive.</l>
     <l n="1501">Soon that discovered she who the flood's realm,</l>
     <l n="1502">Eager for blood, for fifty years held,</l>
     <l n="1503">Grim and greedy, that there some one of men</l>
     <l n="1504">The monster's abode sought out from above.</l>
     <l n="1505">She grasped then against him, the warrior seized</l>
     <l n="1506">In her terrible claws; not sooner she injured</l>
     <l n="1507">His body sound: the burnie him shielded,</l>
     <l n="1508">So that she might not pierce through the corslet,</l>
     <l n="1509">The locked linked sark, with fiendish fingers.</l>
     <l n="1510">Bore then the sea-wolf, when she came to the bottom,</l>
     <l n="1511">The giver of rings to her own abode,</l>
     <l n="1512">So that he might not, tho' he was brave,</l>
     <l n="1513">His weapons wield, but him many strange ones</l>
     <l n="1514">Oppressed in the sea: many a sea-beast</l>
     <l n="1515">With battle-tusks his war-sark brake;</l>
     <l n="1516">The monsters harassed him. The earl then perceived</l>
     <l n="1517">That he in sea-hall, he knew not what, was,</l>
     <l n="1518">Where him no water in aught might harm,</l>
     <l n="1519">Nor for the roofed hall might lay hold of him</l>
     <l n="1520">Sudden grip of the flood: the fire-light he saw,</l>
     <l n="1521">The brilliant beams brightly shining.</l>
     <l n="1522">The good one perceived then the wolf of the bottom,</l>
     <l n="1523">The mighty mere-woman; he gave a strong stroke</l>
     <l n="1524">With his battle-bill, withheld not the blow,</l>
     <l n="1525">So that on her head the ringed blade sounded</l>
     <l n="1526">A greedy war-song. Then the stranger perceived</l>
     <l n="1527">That the war-weapon would not cleave through,</l>
     <l n="1528">Injure her life, but the edge failed</l>
     <l n="1529">The prince in his need: before it endured</l>
     <l n="1530">Many hand-meetings, the helmet oft clave,</l>
     <l n="1531">The fated one's corslet: that was the first time</l>
     <l n="1532">To the dear treasure that power had failed.</l>
     <l n="1533">Again was determined, not lacking in prowess,</l>
     <l n="1534">Mindful of fame, the kinsman of Hygelac:</l>
     <l n="1535">Then threw the etched brand, with jewels adorned,</l>
     <l n="1536">The angry warrior, that it on the earth lay,</l>
     <l n="1537">Strong and steel-edged; he trusted to strength,</l>
     <l n="1538">The hand-grip of might: so shall a man do,</l>
     <l n="1539">When he in war thinketh to gain</l>
     <l n="1540">Praise everlasting, nor for his life careth.</l>
     <l n="1541">Seized then by the shoulder (cared she not for the contest)</l>
     <l n="1542">The War-Geats' prince Grendel's mother,</l>
     <l n="1543">Threw then battle-brave, for he was enraged,</l>
     <l n="1544">The life-destroyer, that she on the floor fell.</l>
     <l n="1545">She him again quickly the hand-grip repaid</l>
     <l n="1546">With her fierce claws, and seized him fast:</l>
     <l n="1547">Then stumbled the weary one, strongest of warriors.</l>
     <l n="1548">The fighter-on-foot, so that he fell.</l>
     <l n="1549">She sat on the hall-guest and drew her short sword.</l>
     <l n="1550">Broad and brown-edged, her son would avenge,</l>
     <l n="1551">Her only child. On his shoulder lay</l>
     <l n="1552">The braided breast-net: that his life saved,</l>
     <l n="1553">Against point and edge entrance withstood.</l>
     <l n="1554">Then had he perished, Ecgtheow's son,</l>

     <l n="1558">Directed the victory, the all-knowing Lord;</l>
     <l n="1559">The Ruler of heaven adjudged it aright;</l>
     <l n="1560">Easily afterwards he again rose.</l>

     <head>XXIII</head>
     <l n="1561">'Mongst the armor he saw then a victory blessed weapon,</l>
     <l n="1562">Old sword of the eotens strong in its edges,</l>
     <l n="1563">Honor of warriors: that was choicest of weapons,</l>
     <l n="1564">But it was greater than any man else</l>
     <l n="1565">To the war-play was able to bear,</l>
     <l n="1566">Good and ornate, the hand-work of giants.</l>
     <l n="1567">He seized the chained hilt, the Scyldings' champion,</l>
     <l n="1568">Raging and battle-fierce, the ringed sword brandished,</l>
     <l n="1569">Hopeless of life angrily struck,</l>
     <l n="1570">So that 'gainst her neck it strongly grasped,</l>
     <l n="1571">Broke the bone-rings; the bill pierced through</l>
     <l n="1572">Her fated body: she on the floor fell;</l>
     <l n="1573">The sword was bloody, in his deed he rejoiced.</l>
     <l n="1574">The blade's beam shone, the light stood within,</l>
     <l n="1575">Just as from heaven brightly doth shine</l>
     <l n="1576">The firmament's candle. He looked through the hall</l>
     <l n="1577">Turned then by the wall, uplifted the weapon</l>
     <l n="1578">Strong by its hilts Higelac's thane,</l>
     <l n="1579">Angry and firm: the edge was not useless</l>
     <l n="1580">To the war-hero, but he quickly would</l>
     <l n="1581">Grendel repay many warlike assaults</l>
     <l n="1582">Of those which he wrought to the West-Danes</l>
     <l n="1583">Oftener by far than for one time,</l>
     <l n="1584">When he of Hrothgar the hearth-companions</l>
     <l n="1585">Slew in their sleep, whilst sleeping ate</l>
     <l n="1586">Of the Danes' folk fifteen of men,</l>
     <l n="1587">And such another bore he away,</l>
     <l n="1588">A sorrowful prey: he paid him for that,</l>
     <l n="1589">The warrior fierce, as he in rest saw</l>
     <l n="1590">Weary of war Grendel there lying</l>
     <l n="1591">Of life deprived, as him before injured</l>
     <l n="1592">The combat at Heorot. His body sprang far,</l>
     <l n="1593">When he after death suffered the blow,</l>
     <l n="1594">The strong sword-stroke, that struck off his head.-</l>
     <l n="1595">Soon that perceived the cunning churls,</l>
     <l n="1596">Those who with Hrothgar gazed on the sea,</l>
     <l n="1597">That the waves-stirring all was commingled,</l>
     <l n="1598">The surge stained with blood. The hoary-haired elders</l>
     <l n="1599">Concerning the good one together thus spoke,</l>
     <l n="1600">That they for the prince looked not again,</l>
     <l n="1601">That he, flushed with victory, would come to seek</l>
     <l n="1602">Their mighty chief, since it seemed to so many</l>
     <l n="1603">That the sea-wolf him had destroyed.</l>
     <l n="1604">Then came the ninth hour; the ness forsook</l>
     <l n="1605">The valiant Scyldings: he departed thence home,</l>
     <l n="1606">The gold-friend of men. The strangers sat,</l>
     <l n="1607">Sick in their mind, and stared on the sea:</l>
     <l n="1608">They knew and weened not, that they their dear lord</l>
     <l n="1609">Himself might see. - The sword then began</l>
     <l n="1610">On account of the battle-gore in clots of blood</l>
     <l n="1611">The war-bill to vanish (that was a wonder),</l>
     <l n="1612">So that it all melted likest to ice,</l>
     <l n="1613">When the frost's fetters the Father unlooses,</l>
     <l n="1614">The ice-rope unwinds, He who has control</l>
     <l n="1615">Of times and tides: that is true Creator.</l>
     <l n="1616">Took he not in the dwelling, the Weder-Geats' prince,</l>
     <l n="1617">More of rich treasures, though he many there saw,</l>
     <l n="1618">But only the head and the hilts together,</l>
     <l n="1619">With jewels adorned: the sword ere melted,</l>
     <l n="1620">The etched brand burnt: the blood was so hot,</l>
     <l n="1621">The strange-spirit poisonous, who therein died.</l>
     <l n="1622">Soon was he swimming who lived through the strife,</l>
     <l n="1623">The foes' fierce assault, dived he up through the water:</l>
     <l n="1624">The stirrings of waves all were cleansed,</l>
     <l n="1625">The regions wide, when the strange-spirit</l>
     <l n="1626">Left his life-days and this fleeting creation.</l>
     <l n="1627">Came then to the land the seamens' protector</l>
     <l n="1628">Strong-minded swimming, joyed in his sea-booty,</l>
     <l n="1629">The mighty burden of what he had with him.</l>
     <l n="1630">They went then to meet him, gave thanks to God</l>
     <l n="1631">The brave band of thanes, rejoiced in their chief,</l>
     <l n="1632">For that they him safe might again see.</l>
     <l n="1633">Then from the strong one helmet and burnie</l>
     <l n="1634">Quickly was loosed: the lake became thick,</l>
     <l n="1635">Water under the clouds stained with war-gore.</l>
     <l n="1636">Forth went they thence on the foot-paths</l>
     <l n="1637">Glad in their hearts, measured the land-ways,</l>
     <l n="1638">The well-known roads; the very bold men</l>
     <l n="1639">From the sea-cliff were beating the head</l>
     <l n="1640">With great exertion to each one of them:</l>
     <l n="1641">Of the courageous four warriors should</l>
     <l n="1642">On the spear-shaft with labor bear</l>
     <l n="1643">To the gold-hall the head of Grendel,</l>
     <l n="1644">Until forthwith to the hall came</l>
     <l n="1645">Fourteen brave men and fierce in war</l>
     <l n="1646">Of the Geats going: the lord of men with them,</l>
     <l n="1647">Brave in the crowd, trod the mead-plains.</l>
     <l n="1648">Then entering came the prince of the thanes,</l>
     <l n="1649">The man brave in deeds, honored in fame,</l>
     <l n="1650">The battle-fierce warrior, Hrothgar to greet.</l>
     <l n="1651">Then was by the hair on the floor borne</l>
     <l n="1652">The head of Grendel, where the men drank,</l>
     <l n="1653">Frightful to earls and the lady also,</l>
     <l n="1654">A wonderful sight: the men on it gazed.</l>

     <head>XXIV</head>
     <l n="1655">Beowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:</l>

     <l n="1657">Prince of the Scyldings, with joy have brought</l>
     <l n="1658">As a token of fame, which thou gazest on here.</l>
     <l n="1659">I that with my life scarcely escaped;</l>
     <l n="1660">Under water in battle risked I the work</l>
     <l n="1661">With great exertion; almost would have been</l>
     <l n="1662">Ended the struggle, had not me God shielded.</l>
     <l n="1663">I might not in battle with Hrunting the sword</l>
     <l n="1664">Aught then perform, though that weapon is good:</l>
     <l n="1665">But the Ruler of men granted to me</l>
     <l n="1666">That I on the wall saw beautiful hanging</l>
     <l n="1667">An old mighty sword (often has He directed</l>
     <l n="1668">Those without friends), that I brandished the weapon.</l>
     <l n="1669">Then I slew in the contest, when time favored me,</l>
     <l n="1670">The house's keepers. Then did the battle-bill,</l>
     <l n="1671">The etched brand, burn, as sprang forth the blood,</l>
     <l n="1672">The hottest of battle-gore: I the hilt thence</l>
     <l n="1673">Bore from my foes, avenged their ill-deeds,</l>
     <l n="1674">Death-plague of the Danes, as it was right.</l>
     <l n="1675">I promise thee then that thou mayest in Heorot,</l>
     <l n="1676">Sorrowless sleep with thy warrior-band,</l>
     <l n="1677">And each of the thanes of thine own people,</l>
     <l n="1678">Of old and of young; thou needst not for them fear,</l>
     <l n="1679">Chief of the Scyldings, from this direction</l>
     <l n="1680">Life-bale for thy earls, as thou didst before,"</l>
     <l n="1681">Then was the golden hilt to the old warrior,</l>
     <l n="1682">The hoary war-chief, given in hand,</l>
     <l n="1683">The old work of giants: it went into the keeping,</l>
     <l n="1684">Since the fall of the devils, of the lord of the Danes,</l>
     <l n="1685">The cunning smiths' work, when this world forsook</l>
     <l n="1686">The bad-hearted being, the opposer of God.</l>
     <l n="1687">Devoted to death, and his mother also.</l>
     <l n="1688">It went into the power of the noblest one</l>
     <l n="1689">Of the world-kings by the two seas,</l>
     <l n="1690">Of those who in Sceden-ig treasure divided.</l>
     <l n="1691">Hrothgar then spoke, on the hilt looked,</l>
     <l n="1692">The old relic on which was the origin written</l>
     <l n="1693">Of an old contest: the flood afterwards slew,</l>
     <l n="1694">The rushing sea, the race of the giants;</l>
     <l n="1695">Badly they fared: that people was hostile</l>
     <l n="1696">To the Lord eternal; therefor a reward</l>
     <l n="1697">Through waters' flood the Almighty them gave.</l>
     <l n="1698">So was on the guard of purest gold</l>
     <l n="1699">In runic letters rightly engraved,</l>
     <l n="1700">Was set and said, for whom that sword,</l>
     <l n="1701">Choicest of weapons, first had been wrought</l>
     <l n="1702">With wreathed hilt snake-adorned. Then the chief spoke,</l>
     <l n="1703">The son of Healfdene (kept silent all):</l>
     <l n="1704">"Lo! that he may say who truth and right</l>
     <l n="1705">Works for his people, the past all remembers,</l>
     <l n="1706">An old home-guardian, that this earl was</l>
     <l n="1707">One born of the best. Thy fame is wide-spread</l>
     <l n="1708">Through distant ways, Beowulf my friend,</l>
     <l n="1709">Over each nation: with patience thou holdest it all,</l>
     <l n="1710">Thy might with prudence of mind. I shall to thee grant</l>
     <l n="1711">My friendship, as we before spoke: thou shalt be for comfort,</l>
     <l n="1712">All long-assured, to thine own people,</l>
     <l n="1713">To heroes for help. Not so was Heremod</l>
     <l n="1714">To the children of Ecgwela, the Honor-Scyldings;</l>
     <l n="1715">He throve not for their pleasure, but for their slaughter,</l>
     <l n="1716">And for death-plagues to the Danes' people:</l>
     <l n="1717">Slew he enraged his table-companions,</l>
     <l n="1718">His chosen comrades, till he went alone,</l>
     <l n="1719">The mighty prince, from human joys:</l>
     <l n="1720">Though him mighty God in joy of strength.</l>
     <l n="1721">In power exalted, over all men</l>
     <l n="1722">Him had uplifted, yet in his heart grew</l>
     <l n="1723">A bloodthirsty feeling: he did not give rings</l>
     <l n="1724">To the Danes by right: joyless abode he,</l>
     <l n="1725">So that for this strife sorrow he suffered,</l>
     <l n="1726">Misery lasting. By that teach thou thyself,</l>
     <l n="1727">Practise man's virtues. This tale for thee</l>
     <l n="1728">Have I, old in years, told. 'Tis a wonder to say</l>
     <l n="1729">How mighty God to the race of mankind,</l>
     <l n="1730">Through His great mind, wisdom divides,</l>
     <l n="1731">Homes and nobility: He rules over all.</l>
     <l n="1732">Sometimes on love permits He to turn</l>
     <l n="1733">The thoughts of the man of mighty race,</l>
     <l n="1734">Gives him in his home the joy of earth,</l>
     <l n="1735">A sheltering city of men to possess,</l>
     <l n="1736">Makes subject to him parts of the world,</l>
     <l n="1737">A kingdom wide, so that he of it may not,</l>
     <l n="1738">For his lack of wisdom, think of the end:</l>
     <l n="1739">He dwells in plenty, nor him does aught check,</l>
     <l n="1740">Sickness nor age, nor for him does sorrow</l>
     <l n="1741">Grow dark in his mind, nor a foe anywhere</l>
     <l n="1742">Show him sword-hate, but for him all the world</l>

     <l n="2045">Then speaks at the beer-drinking he who sees the jewel,</l>
     <l n="2046">An old spear-warrior, who all remembers,</l>
     <l n="2047">Spear-death of men (fierce is his mind),</l>

     <l n="2053">Under his helmet for the last time,</l>

     <l n="2062">With bitter words, until the time comes</l>
     <l n="2063">That the woman's thane, for the deeds of his father,</l>
     <l n="2064">After the sword's stroke blood-stained sleeps,</l>
     <l n="2065">Guilty of his life: thence will the other</l>

     <l n="2074">Yet about Grendel, that thou mayst well know,</l>
     <l n="2075">Giver of treasure, what was the result</l>
     <l n="2076">Of the hand-fight of men. After heaven's gem</l>
     <l n="2077">Glided over the earth, the angry fiend came,</l>
     <l n="2078">The terrible even-guest, to make us a visit,</l>
     <l n="2079">Where we unharmed guarded the hall.</l>
     <l n="2080">There was Hondscio destined for fight,</l>
     <l n="2081">Life-bale to the fated: he lay the first,</l>
     <l n="2082">The belted warrior: to him was Grendel,</l>
     <l n="2083">To the great war-thane, a mouth-destroyer,</l>
     <l n="2084">The dear man's body all he swallowed.</l>
     <l n="2085">Not sooner out then yet empty-handed,</l>
     <l n="2086">The bloody-toothed murderer mindful of woes</l>
     <l n="2087">From the gold-hall was willing to go,</l>
     <l n="2088">But he, strong in might, made trial of me,</l>
     <l n="2089">With ready hand grasped me. His glove was hanging,</l>
     <l n="2090">Wide and wonderful, in cunning bands fast;</l>
     <l n="2091">It was all wrought with curious skill</l>
     <l n="2092">With devil's craft and dragon's skins;</l>
     <l n="2093">He me therein, guiltless of crime,</l>
     <l n="2094">The fierce deed-doer, wished to destroy,</l>
     <l n="2095">One of many: it might not be so,</l>
     <l n="2096">After in anger upright I stood.</l>
     <l n="2097">Too long is to tell how I the folk's foe</l>
     <l n="2098">For each of his ills a hand-reward paid,</l>
     <l n="2099">Where I, my prince, thine own people</l>
     <l n="2100">Honored by deeds. Away he escaped,</l>
     <l n="2101">A little while life's joys enjoyed:</l>
     <l n="2102">Yet of him a trace remained behind,</l>
     <l n="2103">His right hand in Heorot, and he humbled thence,</l>
     <l n="2104">Sorrowing in mind, to the sea-bottom sank.</l>
     <l n="2105">Me for this contest the friend of the Scyldings</l>
     <l n="2106">With plated gold much rewarded,</l>
     <l n="2107">With many treasures, when morning came,</l>
     <l n="2108">And we at the banquet had seated ourselves.</l>
     <l n="2109">There was song and glee: the agéd Scylding,</l>
     <l n="2110">Who much had heard, of past times related;</l>
     <l n="2111">Sometimes the warrior the joy of the harp,</l>
     <l n="2112">The play-wood touched; sometimes sang a song</l>
     <l n="2113">True and sorrowful; sometimes a strange tale</l>
     <l n="2114">Truthfully told the wide-hearted king;</l>
     <l n="2115">Sometimes then began, burdened with age,</l>
     <l n="2116">The hoary warrior to tell of his youth's</l>
     <l n="2117">Prowess in battle; his breast swelled within,</l>
     <l n="2118">When he old in years their number remembered.</l>
     <l n="2119">So we therein the live-long day</l>
     <l n="2120">Partook of hall-joys, until night came on,</l>
     <l n="2121">Another to men. Then was again quickly</l>
     <l n="2122">Ready for vengeance the mother of Grendel.</l>
     <l n="2123">She sorrowful went: death took off her son,</l>
     <l n="2124">War-hate of the Weders. The wondrous woman</l>
     <l n="2125">Her son avenged, a warrior killed</l>
     <l n="2126">Courageously; there was from Aeschere,</l>
     <l n="2127">The aged counsellor, life departed.</l>
     <l n="2128">Nor might they him, when morning came,</l>
     <l n="2129">Delivered to death, the folk of the Danes</l>
     <l n="2130">With fire consume, and on the pyre place</l>
     <l n="2131">The dearly-loved man; the body she bore</l>
     <l n="2132">In the fiend's embrace 'neath the mountain-stream.</l>
     <l n="2133">That was to Hrothgar the greatest of sorrows,</l>
     <l n="2134">Of those that long the prince befell.</l>
     <l n="2135">Then the chief me by thine own life</l>
     <l n="2136">Adjured, sad in mind, that I in the sea's flood</l>

     <l n="2139">I then of the water, which is widely known,</l>
     <l n="2140">The grim and fearful guard of the deep found.</l>
     <l n="2141">There a while was to us a hand-to-hand fight;</l>
     <l n="2142">The sea welled with gore, and I of the head robbed</l>
     <l n="2143">In the ground-hall the mother of Grendel</l>
     <l n="2144">With a strong sword; I scarcely from thence</l>
     <l n="2145">My life bore away; not yet was I fated;</l>
     <l n="2146">But the earl's defence to me after gave</l>

     <l n="2156">He bade then bring in the boar's-head-sign</l>
     <l n="2157">The battle-high helmet, the hoary burnie</l>
     <l n="2158">The war-sword ornate, his word then uttered:</l>

     <l n="2161">That I of its origin first should thee tell,</l>
     <l n="2162">Said that it had Hiorogar king,</l>
     <l n="2163">Prince of the Scyldings, for a long while:</l>
     <l n="2164">Not to his son sooner would he it give,</l>
     <l n="2165">To the brave Heoroweard, though to him he were dear,</l>
     <l n="2166">The defence of the breast. Use thou it well!"</l>
     <l n="2167">I heard that to the armor four horses too,</l>
     <l n="2168">Exactly alike, in their tracks followed,</l>
     <l n="2169">Yellow as apples: he to him gave possession</l>
     <l n="2170">Of horses and jewels. So shall a friend do,</l>
     <l n="2171">Not at all cunning snares weave for another,</l>
     <l n="2172">With secret craft death for him prepare,</l>
     <l n="2173">His hand-companion. To Hygelac was,</l>

     <l n="2175">And each to the other mindful of kindness.</l>
     <l n="2176">I heard that the necklace he to Hygd gave,</l>

     <l n="2182">The man famed in wars, by his good deeds,</l>
     <l n="2183">He did after right, not at all slew the drunken</l>
     <l n="2184">Hearth-companions: his mind was not cruel,</l>
     <l n="2185">But he of mankind with greatest power,</l>
     <l n="2186">The mighty gift, which God him gave,</l>
     <l n="2187">The warlike one kept. Long he was despised,</l>
     <l n="2188">As him the Geats' children did not reckon good,</l>
     <l n="2189">Nor him at the mead-bench as worthy of much</l>
     <l n="2190">The lord of the people would then esteem;</l>
     <l n="2191">They weened very strongly that he was slothful,</l>
     <l n="2192">An unwarlike prince; a change after came</l>
     <l n="2193">To the glory-blessed man of each of his sorrows.</l>
     <l n="2194">The earl's defence bade then bring in,</l>
     <l n="2195">The warlike king, Hrethel's bequest</l>
     <l n="2196">Adorned with gold: there was not 'mong the Geats</l>

     <l n="2203">A wide-spread kingdom, to him who was better.</l>

     <l n="2205">By battle-contests, when Hygelac died,</l>
     <l n="2206">And to Heardred swords of battle</l>
     <l n="2207">Under the shields were as a murderer,</l>

     <l n="2219">Some one of men, who took his desire</l>
     <l n="2220">From the heathen hoard: a certain hand-vessel,</l>
     <l n="2221">Adorned with gold, he there then took,</l>
     <l n="2222">Made of red gold, so that was robbed</l>
     <l n="2223">By the fire sleeping the treasure's guardian</l>

     <l n="2234">The frightened soul who terror suffered,</l>

     <l n="2239">With thoughtful mind there had concealed,</l>

     <l n="2268">Through the hall fly, nor the swift horse</l>
     <l n="2269">The city-courts paw. Mighty death has</l>
     <l n="2270">Many of mortals sent on their way."</l>
     <l n="2271">So sad in mind in sorrow mourned</l>
     <l n="2272">One over all, miserable lived he</l>
     <l n="2273">By day and night, until death's wave</l>
     <l n="2274">Touched him at heart. The precious hoard found</l>
     <l n="2275">The old twilight-foe open standing,</l>
     <l n="2276">He who burning the mountains seeks,</l>

     <l n="2280">The hedge on the earth, where he heathen gold</l>
     <l n="2281">Guards old in years: he shall not be the better.</l>
     <l n="2282">So the folk-foe three hundred winters</l>
     <l n="2283">Held in the earth one of hoard-halls</l>
     <l n="2284">Wondrously great, until him one angered,</l>

     <l n="2286">The jewelled cup, a peace-offering gave</l>
     <l n="2287">To his own lord. Then was the hoard found,</l>
     <l n="2288">Hoard of rings borne away; the prayer was granted</l>
     <l n="2289">To the miserable man: his lord beheld</l>
     <l n="2290">Men's ancient work for the first time.</l>
     <l n="2291">When the dragon awoke, strife was renewed:</l>
     <l n="2292">He went 'round o'er the stone, the brave-minded found</l>
     <l n="2293">His enemy's foot-track: he forth had stepped</l>
     <l n="2294">With secret craft near the head of the dragon.</l>
     <l n="2295">So may one not fated easily escape</l>
     <l n="2296">Woes and exile, who the Almighty's</l>
     <l n="2297">Favor possesses. The hoard-keeper sought</l>
     <l n="2298">O'er the ground eagerly, would find the man,</l>
     <l n="2299">Who to him in sleep this harm had done:</l>
     <l n="2300">Hot and fierce-minded oft he went 'round the cave</l>
     <l n="2301">Now all without: there was not any man</l>
     <l n="2302">On the heath's waste. Yet in battle he joyed,</l>
     <l n="2303">In hostile deeds: he returned to the mountain,</l>
     <l n="2304">The precious cup sought: he that soon found,</l>
     <l n="2305">That some one of men the gold had discovered,</l>
     <l n="2306">The costly treasures. The hoard-keeper waited,</l>

     <l n="2321">The hostile one's hate both near and far,</l>
     <l n="2322">How the war-foe the folk of the Geats</l>
     <l n="2323">Hated and harmed: to his hoard then he hastened,</l>

     <l n="2577">If he that time, on the first day,</l>
     <l n="2578">Was to control as Weird did not permit him</l>
     <l n="2579">Triumph in battle. His hand he uplifted,</l>

     <l n="2582">Brown on the bone, bit less strongly</l>
     <l n="2583">Than the folk-king need of it had,</l>
     <l n="2584">Oppressed with the fight. Then was the hill's keeper,</l>
     <l n="2585">After the battle-blow, fierce in his mood,</l>
     <l n="2586">Threw with death-fire; far and wide spread</l>
     <l n="2587">The flame of the battle. Of triumphs he boasted not,</l>

     <l n="2607">The worthy warrior, prince of the Scylfings,</l>
     <l n="2608">Kinsman of Aelfhere. He saw his lord</l>
     <l n="2609">Under his helmet the heat endure;</l>
     <l n="2610">He remembered the favor, that he once to him gave</l>
     <l n="2611">The rich dwelling-place of the Waegmundings,</l>
     <l n="2612">Each one of folk-rights which his father possessed.</l>
     <l n="2613">He might not then refrain, his hand seized the shield,</l>
     <l n="2614">The yellow wood, he drew his old sword:</l>
     <l n="2615">That was among men Eanmund's bequest,</l>
     <l n="2616">Ohtbere's son, to whom in strife was,</l>
     <l n="2617">To the friendless exile, Weohstan the slayer</l>
     <l n="2618">By the edge of the sword, and he bore to his kinsmen</l>
     <l n="2619">The brown-colored helmet, the ringed burnie,</l>
     <l n="2620">The old giant's sword that Onela gave him,</l>
     <l n="2621">His own relation's war-equipments,</l>
     <l n="2622">Ready war-weapons: he spoke not of the feud,</l>
     <l n="2623">Though he had slain his brother's son.</l>
     <l n="2624">He the ornaments held many half-years,</l>
     <l n="2625">Bill and burnie, until his son might</l>
     <l n="2626">Heroic deeds work, as his old father:</l>
     <l n="2627">He gave to him then war-weeds 'mong the Geats,</l>
     <l n="2628">Countless number of each, when he from life went</l>
     <l n="2629">Old on his last journey. Then was the first time</l>
     <l n="2630">To the young warrior that in storm of war</l>
     <l n="2631">With his dear lord he should engage;</l>
     <l n="2632">His courage failed not, nor his kinsman's bequest</l>
     <l n="2633">Softened in battle: that the dragon perceived,</l>
     <l n="2634">After they two together had gone.</l>
     <l n="2635">Wiglaf then spoke many suitable words,</l>
     <l n="2636">Said to his comrades (sad was his mind):</l>
     <l n="2637">"I remember that time when we received mead,</l>
     <l n="2638">When we did promise to our dear lord</l>
     <l n="2639">In the beer-hall, who gave us these rings,</l>
     <l n="2640">That we for the war-weeds him would repay,</l>
     <l n="2641">If to him such need ever should happen,</l>
     <l n="2642">For helmets and hard swords, since in host he us chose</l>
     <l n="2643">For this expedition of his own will,</l>
     <l n="2644">Thought of honors for us, and gave me these treasures,</l>
     <l n="2645">Us whom he deemed spear-warriors good,</l>
     <l n="2646">Brave helmet-bearers, although our lord</l>
     <l n="2647">This noble work intended alone</l>
     <l n="2648">To accomplish for us, ward of his folk,</l>
     <l n="2649">Because he of men most noble deeds did,</l>
     <l n="2650">Rashly-bold actions. Now is the day come</l>
     <l n="2651">That our own chieftain has need of the strength</l>
     <l n="2652">Of warriors good: let us to him go.</l>
     <l n="2653">Help the war-prince whilst there is heat,</l>
     <l n="2654">Fierce fiery terror. God knows in me,</l>
     <l n="2655">That to me 'tis far dearer that my own body</l>
     <l n="2656">With my gold-giver the flame should embrace.</l>
     <l n="2657">Not becoming, methinks, is't that we should bear shields</l>
     <l n="2658">Again to our home, unless we may sooner</l>
     <l n="2659">Strike down the foe, the life protect</l>
     <l n="2660">Of the Weders' chief. I know it well,</l>
     <l n="2661">That he does not deserve that he alone shall</l>
     <l n="2662">Of the Geats' nobles sorrow endure,</l>
     <l n="2663">Fall in the battle: now shall sword and helmet,</l>
     <l n="2664">Burnie and battle-dress, to us both be common."</l>
     <l n="2665">Went he then through the flame, his war-helmet bore</l>
     <l n="2666">For help to his lord, spoke a few words:</l>
     <l n="2667">"Beowulf dear! do thou all well,</l>
     <l n="2668">As thou in thy youth long ago said'st,</l>
     <l n="2669">That thou would'st not let for thyself living</l>
     <l n="2670">Honor e'er cease; now shalt thou, strong in deeds,</l>
     <l n="2671">Firm-minded prince, with all thy might</l>
     <l n="2672">Thy life protect; I shall assist thee."</l>
     <l n="2673">After these words the angry worm came,</l>
     <l n="2674">The terrible demon, a second time</l>
     <l n="2675">With fire-waves shining to seek his foes,</l>
     <l n="2676">The hostile men. With flame-billows burned</l>
     <l n="2677">The shield to the rim: the burnie might not</l>
     <l n="2678">To the young spear-warrior assistance afford.</l>
     <l n="2679">But the young hero 'neath the shield of his kinsman</l>
     <l n="2680">With courage went. when his own was</l>
     <l n="2681">Destroyed by flames. Then still the war-king</l>
     <l n="2682">Was mindful of fame, of his mighty strength,</l>
     <l n="2683">Struck with his war-bill, that it stood in the head</l>
     <l n="2684">Forcibly driven: broke in two Naegling,</l>
     <l n="2685">Failed in battle Beowulf's sword,</l>
     <l n="2686">Old and gray-etched. 'T was not granted to him,</l>
     <l n="2687">That him of the sword the edges were able</l>
     <l n="2688">To help in the battle: that hand was too strong,</l>
     <l n="2689">Which any of swords, by my hearsay,</l>
     <l n="2690">With its stroke tested, when to battle he bore</l>
     <l n="2691">The sharp-wounding weapon: 'twas not for him better.</l>
     <l n="2692">Then was the folk-foe for the third time,</l>
     <l n="2693">The bold fire-dragon, mindful of feuds,</l>
     <l n="2694">Rushed on the strong one, since space him allowed,</l>
     <l n="2695">Hot and war-fierce, clasped around all the neck</l>
     <l n="2696">With his sharp bones: he was all bloodied</l>
     <l n="2697">With the life-blood; gore welled in waves.</l>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="2693">
     <head>XXXVII</head>
     <l n="2698">Then I heard say in the folk-king's need</l>
     <l n="2699">The earl displayed unceasing bravery,</l>
     <l n="2700">Strength and valor, as was natural to him:</l>
     <l n="2701">He cared not for his head, but the hand burned</l>
     <l n="2702">Of the brave man, where he helped with his strength,</l>
     <l n="2703">So that the fell demon he struck somewhat lower,</l>
     <l n="2704">The hero in armor, that the sword sank in,</l>
     <l n="2705">Shining and gold-plated, that the fire began</l>
     <l n="2706">After to lessen. Then still the king</l>
     <l n="2707">His senses possessed, struck with his war-knife,</l>
     <l n="2708">Cutting and battle-sharp, which he bore on his burnie:</l>
     <l n="2709">The Weders' defence cut the serpent in two.</l>
     <l n="2710">The foe they felled, force drove out life,</l>
     <l n="2711">And they him then both had destroyed,</l>
     <l n="2712">Kindred princes: such should a man be,</l>
     <l n="2713">A thane in need. That was to the prince</l>
     <l n="2714">The last of his victories by his own deeds,</l>
     <l n="2715">Of work in the world. Then 'gan the wound,</l>
     <l n="2716">Which on him the earth-drake before had inflicted,</l>
     <l n="2717">To burn and to swell: that soon he perceived</l>
     <l n="2718">That in his breast deadly ill welled,</l>
     <l n="2719">Poison within. Then the prince went,</l>
     <l n="2720">So that he by the rock, wise in his mind,</l>
     <l n="2721">Sat on his seat, on the giants' work looked,</l>
     <l n="2722">How the stone-arches, fast on their columns,</l>
     <l n="2723">The earth-hall eternal held there within.</l>
     <l n="2724">Then with his hands him bloody with gore,</l>
     <l n="2725">The mighty prince, the excellent thane</l>
     <l n="2726">His own dear lord with water laved,</l>
     <l n="2727">Weary of battle, and his helmet unloosed.</l>
     <l n="2728">Beowulf said: he spoke of his wound,</l>
     <l n="2729">His deadly-pale wound (he knew very well</l>
     <l n="2730">That he had spent his time allotted</l>
     <l n="2731">Of the joy of earth; then was all gone</l>
     <l n="2732">Of his days' number, death very nigh):</l>
     <l n="2733">" Now I to my son would wish to give</l>
     <l n="2734">These war-weeds of mine, if to me was granted</l>
     <l n="2735">Any inheritor hereafter to be</l>
     <l n="2736">The heir of my body. This people I ruled</l>
     <l n="2737">Fifty of winters; there was not a folk-king,</l>
     <l n="2738">Of those dwelling around any at all,</l>
     <l n="2739">Who me durst meet with his war-friends,</l>
     <l n="2740">With terror oppress. I awaited at home</l>
     <l n="2741">The appointed time, kept mine own well,</l>
     <l n="2742">Sought not hostilities, nor for myself swore</l>
     <l n="2743">Many oaths falsely; I for all that,</l>
     <l n="2744">With deadly wounds sick, now joy may have;</l>
     <l n="2745">Hence the ruler of men need not to me charge</l>
     <l n="2746">The murder of kinsmen, when shall depart</l>
     <l n="2747">My life from my body. Now do thou quickly go</l>
     <l n="2748">To see the hoard 'neath the hoar stone,</l>
     <l n="2749">Wiglaf my dear one, now the serpent lies dead,</l>
     <l n="2750">Sleeps sorely wounded, robbed of his treasure.</l>
     <l n="2751">Be now in haste that I the old riches,</l>
     <l n="2752">The treasure may view, thoroughly scan</l>
     <l n="2753">The bright precious gems, that I may the easier,</l>

     <l n="2756">Then heard I that quickly Weohstan's son,</l>
     <l n="2757">After these words, his wounded lord</l>
     <l n="2758">Sick from battle obeyed, bore his ringed net,</l>
     <l n="2759">His battle-sark woven, 'neath the roof of the mountain</l>
     <l n="2760">Saw then victorious, when he by the seat went,</l>
     <l n="2761">The brave kin-thane many of treasures.</l>
     <l n="2762">Glittering gold on the ground lying,</l>
     <l n="2763">Wonder on wall and the den of the worm,</l>
     <l n="2764">The old air-flier, drinking-cups standing,</l>
     <l n="2765">Vessels of old-time wanting the polisher,</l>
     <l n="2766">Deprived of their ornaments. There was many a helmet</l>
     <l n="2767">Old and rusty, many arm-bracelets</l>
     <l n="2768">Curiously twisted. The treasure may easily,</l>
     <l n="2769">The gold in the ground, each hoard of mankind</l>
     <l n="2770">In value exceed, let him hide it who will.</l>
     <l n="2771">Likewise he saw standing an all-golden banner</l>
     <l n="2772">High over the hoard, greatest of wonders,</l>
     <l n="2773">Wrought with hand-craft; from it light stood,</l>
     <l n="2774">So that the ground-plain he might perceive,</l>

     <l n="2780">At his own will; the banner he took,</l>
     <l n="2781">Brightest of beacons, a bill sheathed with brass</l>
     <l n="2782">(Its edge was of iron) of the old lord,</l>
     <l n="2783">Who of these treasures was the protector</l>
     <l n="2784">For a long while, bore fiery terror</l>
     <l n="2785">Hot, deadly-rolling, on account of the hoard</l>
     <l n="2786">In the midst of the night, till he in death perished.</l>
     <l n="2787">In haste was the messenger for return ready,</l>
     <l n="2788">Provided with treasures; wonder him moved,</l>
     <l n="2789">Whether he the high-minded alive would find</l>
     <l n="2790">In that grassy spot, the prince of the Weders,</l>

     <l n="2794">At the end of his life. He began him again</l>
     <l n="2795">With water to sprinkle, until the word's point</l>
     <l n="2796">Brake through his breast-hoard: Beowulf spoke,</l>

     <l n="2802">Before my death-day such treasures obtain.</l>
     <l n="2803">Now I for the hoard of jewels have paid</l>

     <l n="2805">The needs of my people; I may not longer be here</l>
     <l n="2806">Bid ye the war-famed a mound to make</l>
     <l n="2807">Bright after the pyre at the sea's point,</l>

     <l n="2811">Beowulf's mound, who shall their high ships</l>
     <l n="2812">O'er the sea's mists from afar drive."</l>
     <l n="2813">He put from his neck the golden ring,</l>
     <l n="2814">The bold-minded prince, gave to the thane,</l>
     <l n="2815">The young spear-warrior, his gold-adorned helm,</l>

     <l n="2897">Upon the steep cliff, where the earl-band</l>
     <l n="2898">The morning-long day sad in mind sat,</l>
     <l n="2899">The warriors with shields, in expectance of both,</l>
     <l n="2900">The final day and the return</l>
     <l n="2901">Of the dear man. Little kept silent</l>
     <l n="2902">Of the new tidings he who rode o'er the ness,</l>
     <l n="2903">But he in truth spoke on all sides:</l>
     <l n="2904">" Now is the joy-giver of the folk of the Weders,</l>

     <l n="2913">With care attentive, keeps the death-watch</l>
     <l n="2914">Of friend and of foe. Now the people expect</l>
     <l n="2915">A time of strife, after well-known</l>
     <l n="2916">To the Franks and the Frisians the fall of the king</l>
     <l n="2917">Becomes far and wide. The contest was made</l>
     <l n="2918">Strong 'gainst the Hugs, when Higelac came</l>
     <l n="2919">With his ship-army going to the land of the Frisians,</l>
     <l n="2920">Where the Hetwaras felled him in battle,</l>
     <l n="2921">Bravely him conquered with their over-might,</l>
     <l n="2922">So that the mailed-warrior was forced to bow,</l>
     <l n="2923">Fell midst his warriors; no ornaments gave</l>
     <l n="2924">The prince to his nobles. To us ever after</l>
     <l n="2925">The Merwings' friendship was not to be granted.</l>
     <l n="2926">Nor do I from the Swedes peace or good faith</l>
     <l n="2927">At all expect; but it was widely known</l>
     <l n="2928">That Ongentheow of life deprived</l>
     <l n="2929">Haethcyn, Hrethel's son, near Ravens' wood,</l>
     <l n="2930">When through their pride at first did seek</l>
     <l n="2931">The warlike Scylfings the folk of the Geats.</l>
     <l n="2932">Soon to him the agéd father of Ohthere,</l>
     <l n="2933">Old and terrible, gave a hand-stroke,</l>
     <l n="2934">Hewed down the sea-chief, rescued his wife,</l>
     <l n="2935">The old man his spouse, robbed of her gold,</l>
     <l n="2936">The mother of Onela and of Ohthere,</l>
     <l n="2937">And then he followed his deadly foes</l>
     <l n="2938">Until they went in great distress</l>
     <l n="2939">Into Ravens' wood, deprived of their lord.</l>
     <l n="2940">Then besieged he with host those left by the sword,</l>
     <l n="2941">Weary with wounds, woes oft he promised</l>
     <l n="2942">To the miserable band the livelong night:</l>
     <l n="2943">Said, he in the morning with the edge of the sword</l>
     <l n="2944">Them would destroy, some on gallows hang</l>
     <l n="2945">For sport to the fowls. Comfort afterwards came</l>
     <l n="2946">To them sad in mind along with daylight,</l>
     <l n="2947">After they Hygelac's horn and trumpets'</l>

     <l n="2950">There was bloody track of Swedes and of Geats,</l>
     <l n="2951">The slaughter of men widely observed,</l>
     <l n="2952">How the folk fought the feud one with another.</l>
     <l n="2953">The good one then went with his companions,</l>
     <l n="2954">The aged most sad, the fastness to seek,</l>
     <l n="2955">The earl Ongentheow betook himself higher;</l>
     <l n="2956">He had of Hygelac's prowess heard tell,</l>
     <l n="2957">The proud one's war-craft; in resistance he trusted not,</l>
     <l n="2958">That he the sea-men might then withstand,</l>
     <l n="2959">His hoard protect from the sea-farers,</l>
     <l n="2960">His children and wife; he went after thence</l>
     <l n="2961">Old 'neath the earth-wall. Then was given pursuit</l>
     <l n="2962">To the folk of the Swedes, their banner to Hygelac.</l>
     <l n="2963">Forth then they went o'er the Peace-plain,</l>
     <l n="2964">After the Hrethlings pressed into the hedge;</l>
     <l n="2965">There Ongentheow was, with the edge of the sword,</l>
     <l n="2966">The gray-haired one, forced to remain,</l>
     <l n="2967">So that the folk-king had to submit</l>
     <l n="2968">To Eofor's sole will; angrily him</l>
     <l n="2969">Wulf, son of Wonred, attacked with his weapon,</l>
     <l n="2970">So that for the blow blood spurted in streams</l>
     <l n="2971">Forth under his hair. He was not though afraid.</l>
     <l n="2972">The agéd Scylfing, but quickly repaid</l>
     <l n="2973">In a worse way that fatal blow,</l>
     <l n="2974">After the folk-king thither turned round:</l>
     <l n="2975">Might not then the quick son of Wonred</l>
     <l n="2976">To the old churl a hand-stroke give,</l>
     <l n="2977">But he on his head his helmet first cleft,</l>
     <l n="2978">So that, stained with blood, he had to bow,</l>
     <l n="2979">Fell on the earth: he was not yet fated,</l>
     <l n="2980">But he himself raised, though the wound pained him</l>
     <l n="2981">Then the brave thane of Hygelac let</l>
     <l n="2982">With his broad sword, when his brother lay down,</l>
     <l n="2983">The old sword of giants, the helmet of giants</l>
     <l n="2984">Break over the shield-rim: then bowed the king,</l>
     <l n="2985">The herd of the folk; he was struck to his life.</l>
     <l n="2986">Then were there many who bound up his brother,</l>
     <l n="2987">Quickly him lifted, when for them it was settled</l>
     <l n="2988">That they the battle-place were to possess,</l>
     <l n="2989">Whilst one warrior the other robbed,</l>
     <l n="2990">From Ongentheow took his burnie of iron,</l>
     <l n="2991">His hard hilted sword and his helmet besides,</l>
     <l n="2992">The hoary one's armor to Hygelac bore.</l>
     <l n="2993">The armor he took and to them fairly promised</l>
     <l n="2994">Gifts to his people, and kept his word too.</l>
     <l n="2995">The lord of the Geats paid for the contest,</l>
     <l n="2996">The son of Hrethel, when he came to his home,</l>
     <l n="2997">To Eofor and Wulf with very rich jewels,</l>
     <l n="2998">To each of them gave a hundred thousand</l>
     <l n="2999">Of land and locked rings (for the gifts him need not reproach</l>
     <l n="3000">Any man on mid-earth, since they heroic deeds wrought),</l>
     <l n="3001">And then to Eofor gave his sole daughter,</l>
     <l n="3002">The home-adornment, as a pledge of his favor.</l>
     <l n="3003">That is the feud and that the enmity,</l>
     <l n="3004">Hate deadly of men, wherefore I expect</l>
     <l n="3005">That the Swedes' people against us will seek,</l>
     <l n="3006">After they learn that our own lord</l>
     <l n="3007">Is 'reft of his life, him who before held</l>
     <l n="3008">Against his foes his hoard and kingdom</l>
     <l n="3009">After heroes' fall, the Scylfings brave,</l>
     <l n="3010">Wrought his folk's good and further still</l>
     <l n="3011">Heroic deeds did. - Now is haste best</l>
     <l n="3012">That we the folk-king there should behold,</l>
     <l n="3013">And him should bring who gave us rings</l>
     <l n="3014">To the funeral-pyre. There shall not a part only</l>
     <l n="3015">With the brave perish, but there's hoard of treasure,</l>
     <l n="3016">Gold without number, bitterly purchased,</l>
     <l n="3017">And now at the last with his own life</l>
     <l n="3018">Rings has he bought: these fire shall devour,</l>
     <l n="3019">The flame consume; no earl shall wear</l>
     <l n="3020">A jewel in memory, nor the beautiful maid</l>
     <l n="3021">Have on her neck a ring-adornment,</l>
     <l n="3022">But she shall sad in mind, robbed of her gold,</l>
     <l n="3023">Often not once tread a strange land.</l>
     <l n="3024">Now that the war-chief laughter has left,</l>
     <l n="3025">Mirth and enjoyment. For this shall the spear be,</l>
     <l n="3026">Many a one morning-cold, clasped with the fingers,</l>
     <l n="3027">field in the hands; not at all shall harp's sound</l>
     <l n="3028">Wake up the warriors, but the wan raven,</l>
     <l n="3029">Eager over the fated, often shall speak,</l>
     <l n="3030">Say to the eagle how he joyed in the eating.</l>
     <l n="3031">When with the wolf he robbed the slain."</l>
     <l n="3032">So the brave warrior then was telling</l>
     <l n="3033">Some tales of evil: he did not speak falsely</l>
     <l n="3034">His facts nor words. -The band all arose;</l>
     <l n="3035">Sadly they went 'neath the Eagles' ness,</l>
     <l n="3036">With flowing tears, the wonder to see.</l>
     <l n="3037">Then they found on the sand deprived of his life,</l>
     <l n="3038">Holding his resting-place, him who rings them gave</l>
     <l n="3039">In former times: then was the last day</l>
     <l n="3040">Past to the good one, so that the war-king,</l>
     <l n="3041">The prince of the Weders, a wondrous death died.</l>
     <l n="3042">First there they saw a stranger being,</l>
     <l n="3043">The worm on the plain opposite there,</l>
     <l n="3044">The loathsome one lying; the fiery dragon,</l>
     <l n="3045">The terror grim, was scorched with flames;</l>
     <l n="3046">He was fifty feet, in his full measure,</l>
     <l n="3047">Long as he lay; the air he enjoyed</l>
     <l n="3048">Sometimes at night, down again went</l>
     <l n="3049">To visit his den: he was then fast in death,</l>
     <l n="3050">He had enjoyed the last of earth-caves.</l>
     <l n="3051">By him there stood pitchers and cups,</l>
     <l n="3052">Plates too lay there and precious swords,</l>
     <l n="3053">Rusty and eaten-through, as in the earth's bosom</l>
     <l n="3054">A thousand of winters there they had remained,</l>
     <l n="3055">Since that bequest exceedingly great,</l>
     <l n="3056">The gold of the ancients, was bewitched with a spell,</l>
     <l n="3057">So that the ringed hall might one not touch,</l>
     <l n="3058">Any of men, unless God himself,</l>
     <l n="3059">True King of victories, to whom He would granted</l>

     <l n="3062">Then was it seen that the way did not prosper</l>
     <l n="3063">To him who with wrong had hid within</l>
     <l n="3064">The hoard 'neath the wall. The keeper ere slew</l>
     <l n="3065">Some one of his foes: then was the feud</l>
     <l n="3066">With battle avenged. Is it a wonder</l>
     <l n="3067">When a warlike earl the end approaches</l>
     <l n="3068">Of his life-fate, when may no longer</l>
     <l n="3069">A man with his kinsmen a mead-hall in-dwell?</l>
     <l n="3070">So was it to Beowulf, when he the mount's keeper,</l>
     <l n="3071">The contest sought: he himself knew not</l>
     <l n="3072">How his world-severing was to take place;</l>
     <l n="3073">How it against doom's-day deeply had cursed</l>
     <l n="3074">The mighty princes who that put there,</l>

     <l n="3076">Shut up in cursed places, fast in hell-bonds,</l>
     <l n="3077">Punished with plagues, who should that plain tread</l>
     <l n="3078">He was not gold-greedy; he rather would have</l>
     <l n="3079">The owner's favor sooner looked on.-</l>
     <l n="3080">Wiglaf then spoke, Weohstan's son:</l>
     <l n="3081">"Oft many an earl for the sake of one</l>
     <l n="3082">Sorrow shall suffer, as is happened to us.</l>

     <l n="3088">Fulfil his high fate. The hoard is looked on,</l>
     <l n="3089">Bitterly gotten: that fate was too mighty</l>
     <l n="3090">Which that folk-king thither enticed.</l>
     <l n="3091">I was therein and looked through it all,</l>
     <l n="3092">The treasures of hall, when 'twas allowed me,</l>
     <l n="3093">Not at all friendly a journey permitted</l>
     <l n="3094">In 'neath the earth-wall. In haste I took</l>
     <l n="3095">A great mighty burden with my own hands</l>
     <l n="3096">Of the hoard-treasures, bore them out hither</l>
     <l n="3097">To mine own king: he was then still alive,</l>
     <l n="3098">Wise and still conscious: very much spoke</l>
     <l n="3099">The agéd in sorrow and ordered to greet you,</l>
     <l n="3100">Bade that ye should, for your friend's deeds, make</l>
     <l n="3101">On the place of the pyre the lofty mound,</l>
     <l n="3102">Mickle and mighty, as he of men was</l>
     <l n="3103">The most worthy warrior through the wide earth,</l>
     <l n="3104">While he city-treasures still could enjoy.</l>
     <l n="3105">Let us now hasten a second time</l>
     <l n="3106">To see and to seek that heap of treasures,</l>
     <l n="3107">Wonder 'neath wall. I shall direct you,</l>

     <l n="3122">Leaped over the shield-wall, the shaft did its duty,</l>
     <l n="3123">Fitted with feathers followed the barb."</l>
     <l n="3124">Now then the wise son of Weohstan</l>

     <l n="3130">It was not then allotted who should plunder that hoard,</l>
