**Abstract**: A consensus once existed in support of the claim that _Widsið_ is the oldest extant poem in English and one of the earliest substantial documents written in any Germanic language. This consensus came to an end in the 1980s, when scholars became more skeptical about the dating of Old English poetry. Recent work on _Widsið_ contends that there is little evidence supporting the presumed early date of composition. This essay argues, however, that four categories of evidence can be brought to bear on the dating of _Widsið_---orthographic, lexical, onomastic, and cultural---and that all four of these categories agree in support of an early date of composition. It also argues that, as an early poem, _Widsið_ has much to contribute to the lively discussions of early medieval historians concerned with Germanic identity and the ethnogenesis of early medieval _gentes_.

* George K. Anderson believed lines 18-35 predated the Anglo-Saxon Migration.
* Alfred Anscombe dated it to 460 AD.
* Kemp Malone argued it was compiled as a whole in the late 7th century.
* Chambers, claiming a moderate view, dates it to the late 7th century as a whole. 
* Frank, Hill, and Niles argue for a later date (Neidorf claims without providing any evidence for it)
* "Frank, Hill, and Niles offer no substantial engagement with the dating arguments of earlier _Widsið_ scholars. The reader is simplet left to imagine that there really is no evidence for an early dating of _Widsið_ and that scholarship had operated under a delusion for over 100 and 50 years." (166)
* "A graver consequence is that, by creating the impression that all Old English poems are undatable, Anglo-Saxonists have limited the potential usefulness of their object of study for historians concerned with the chronology and pattern of medieval cultural developments."(167)
* Manuscript unlikely to have been written after 975 (167)
* "Yet, while the existence of a _koine_ certainly does account for the use of many dialectally restricted poetic vocabularly words (i.e., Northumbrian _mece_), it does not explain the presence of proper names rendered in dialectally distinct orthography."(169)
* I'm not as sold on the onomastic section
* There was no Pan-Germanic identity
* These statements have been, perhaps, overstated lately as a reaction to Nazism when much was made of pan-Germanic unity.
* Neidorf traces the condensing of Bede's "Frisians, Rugians, Danes, Huns, Old Saxons, and Boruhtware" to just the Angles and the Saxons in _The Battle of Brunanburg_ and then to the Englsh in Wulfstan's _Sermo Lupi ad Anglos_ of 1014.
* Argument that Widsith only provides an Anglian perspective. He attaches the Angles to the Swabians but never the Saxons, and celebrates Offa for ten lines but doesn't mention any Saxon leader. It is perhaps that they share a Germanic heroic culture, while not sharing an immediate culture here and now.
* Mentions that Engle and Seaxe are metrically equivalent to Engle and Swæfe but still the poet never uses it. The _Beowulf_ poet also discusses the deeds of many tribes but never mentions the Saxons.
