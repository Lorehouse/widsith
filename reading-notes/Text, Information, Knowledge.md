### Notes and Quotes
- Look into the Natural Language Processing Research Group at the University of Sheffield
- "well edited digital primary sources are crucial tools in any large digital library" (4)
-  "Classicists showed great wisdom in establishing and maintaining authoritative citation schemes for most of their primary sources well before the twentieth century" (5). This is also an important case against Malone's rearrangement of the text. 
- "Commentary A may be keyed to the Riverside edition of Hamlet, while commentary B may be keyed to the older Globe Shakespeare: by aligning Globe and Riverside editions of Shakespeare, we can align entries in the previously incommensurate commentaries" (5).
- "Thus, one marked-up edition of a major canonical text in a large digital library can, with standard techniques available today, provide the structure to align dozens of editions, hundreds of translations and quotations in thousands of secondary sources. (5)"
