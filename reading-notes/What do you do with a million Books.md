## Notes and Quotes

He brings up how the card-catalogue concept is a holdover from print libraries that we can't get ourselves to let go of when actual usage shows that people want content, not catalogues. He mentions Google's success at sending people straight to answers, not making them weed through things. This feels really relevant to the current AI results and of course the complaints that have been going on for years about Google providing answers on the search results page, meaning the actual sources lose that click-through and ad revenue.
"Already the books in a digital library are beginning to read one another and to confer among themselves before creating a new synthetic document for review by their human readers (1)."
In figure one he points out 1) how reference systems are no longer based on page-breaks, rather based on some established authority (like line numbers of poems), 2) that the digital library automatically scans new documents for references to Catullus (the reference document), and 3) and how the documents learn from their users (through feedback options that allow the user to adjust the text as they need). 
"On a broader level, we are facing a shift that may eclipse the significance of print and approach the impact of writing itself: for writing first stored human ideas outside of our brains and print enhanced the effect. Digital libraries, where books read one another in however a rudimentary fashion [I'd restructure this sentence if I were the editor haha], have already begun to separate intelligence and action from the human brain."
Dr. Crane points out that these digital libraries will differ from previous ones in terms of scale, variety of content, granularity of content, "noise" (less curation and careful refining by human agents, especially within books in older forms of English or in historical languages), Audience (the general public rather than academics), and collectors and distributors.
**Analog to text** - issues dealing with layout of text that is not straightforward like footnotes, entries in lexica, encyclopedias, etc. References #SayeedChoudhury
**Machine translation** - identifies the possibilities of large corpora aiding machine translation, references #DavidASmith 
**Information extraction** - identifying individual elements with in a text (Names, dates, etc) as well as embedded quotations, textual links, etc.
