### Notes and Quotes
- "fluid text is a fact, not a theory" from John Bryant
- *"ever since antiquity the purpose of editorial work has been the production of the one, true, 'official' version of the text from the many that are available." (42)*
- *"For example, with highly elaborative traditions such as epic or sermons alteration and therefore the creation of new versions was considered normal practice, at least for some types of texts. The textual variety of medieval texts has been seen (and in some cases is still seen) by many scholars as a problem to fix in the quest for the original text." (44)*
- *"In his (Cerquiglini) vision, manuscripts are no longer simply witnesses to works but witnesses to culture, and ought therefore to be studied in their own right." (44-45)*
- Addressing the critical apparatus of producing critical editions: *"However, criticism of the apparatus still stands: its highly condensed and abbreviated formalism, elaborated for a technology where space is limited, constitutes a cultural threshold only accessible by people with the highest level of education in the very specific field that has produced such a product." (45)* 
- *"John Lavagnino for instance, presents the case of the variorum edition of S.T. Coleridge's poems edited by J.C.C. Mays, but then he agrees that such an edition is not easy to use, as it takes 'six volumes for what a conventional presentation could easily fit into one'."(46)* Here the Digital Tolkien Project is an example of a project that aims to make accessible a multitude of versions and the evolution of various tales and poems across a lifetime of the author's work. 
- *"Critical editions are often difficult and time-consuming to produce and, in  the case of very complex textual traditions, can become lifelong projects, representing the culmination of the intellectual career of a scholar." (46)* Something to think about.
- *"The provision of 'clean' reading texts, where almost no traces of the underlying editorial work are visible, have contributed to giving readers a false impression that stability, a 'trueness' of the texts, is an achievable goal, and that texts exist in a sort of pure, Neo-Platonic state, which should not be stained by editorial marks or doubts." (47)* By making texts accessible to the public, we hope to dispel this worship of the "one true text" and some concept of canonicity that plagues fandom, religion, and scholarship-lite.
- *"Generations of scholars \[in the Italian tradition] have been formed in the belief that any edition is only a working hypothesis and that the original can only ever be approximated but never attained." (48)*  
- *"As stated by Robinson 'it appears that rather few readers (indeed, rather often, only editors) actually want to see all the images, all the transcripts, all the collations, and while 'printed editions acted as filters', the digital medium provides readers with an overload of unregulated data that struggles to become information, since 'value \[...] is added through \[a] chain of literary agents, specialist readers, editors and publishers'." (50)*
- *"In the sciences there is an established tradition of encouraging the general public to engage with scientific discovery, resulting in a rapid growth in the science communication industry as demonstrated by a number of teaching programmes that have recently emerged." (55)*
- *"One obvious problem is the increased difficulty in citing texts. To affirm that all academic culture is based on citations may be an exaggeration, yet the possibility of tracing and attributing a certain portion of text to a specific source is a fundamental requirement for any publication wanting to be defined as scholarly. (56-57)* How to make the project citable and not just the poem? 
- *"Digital mutability may respond well to textual mutability but only if the latter is recognised and embraced, and if we make a feature of it rather than considering it a bug. (58)*
