## Notes and Quotes

- This is the paper by Patrick Sahle from _Digital Scholarly Editing_. The idea that my critical edition requires the application of wide knowledge "ranging from material and bibliographic criticism to historical understanding and textual criticism" (19) is distressing because I definitely don't feel like I have this wide range of knowledge. I definitely am not among the "best experts in a field".
- These critical editions attempt to either establish an Urtext, perhaps lost and cobbled together from references, or to determine with absolute certainty what the author intended for a text that has otherwise been altered and contaminated through transmission. Neither of these things is my goal either.
- I am going to keep working through this paper about Scholarly Digital Editions. I definitely need to make sure I read Peter Robinson's "What is a Critical Digital Edition" from _Variants: The Journal of the European Society for Textual Scholarship_ (2002), even though that's practically a fossil in the timeline of computer development.
- Sahle seems to be trying to differentiate a true SDE from simply a digital edition, or a scholarly edition that happens to be accessed from the internet. What tools make it both a scholarly and a digital edition? This requires that it not only have the rigor of a print scholarly edition but also the characteristics (which I assume he will define) of a born-digital edition.
- He mentions that the practice of constructing a text beyond the actual document witnesses (Urtext creation) as the main goal of editing has been questioned since the beginning.
- First he defines a **Scholarly Edition**
	- Presents the definition _"A scholarly edition is the critical representation of historic documents."_ (23)
	- It must **represent** the document(s) in some way in its entirety, rather than simply a presentation. Perhaps this is the distinction between, say, a facsimile edition, and a normalized (by a scholar) edition.
	- It must engage in **criticism**, not constrained to textual criticism. Criticism is all the processes that engage in a reflective way with the material, "opening it up".
	- Sahle chooses the word **document** rather than text or work. Materials do not, he argues, all have a textual component. This is at odds with the Treharne and Willan book's definition of "text" [[Text Technologies]]
- Next he defines a Scholarly **Digital Edition**
	- He argues that a print edition is a particular form of a scholarly edition that often stems from a digital edition, as these editions are usually created digitally.
	- the **digital paradigm** has possibilities beyond the print paradigm, shaped by the potential of the media as the print paradigm was shaped by the "technical limitations and cultural practices of typography and book printing."
	- _A digitised edition is not a digital edition._
	- _A digital edition cannot be given in print without significant loss of content and functionality._
	- The interactivity, potentially limitless views, the control over behaviour and appearance are innate features of a digital edition.
	- Key Takeaway: _Scholarly digital editions are scholarly editions that are guided by a digital paradigm in their theory, method, and practice._
- Digital editions are characterised by fluidity of text:
	- This is both the hyperlinking ability and the modularised text-structures, which are generated in real-time and represent the most current state of data
	- The other is the loss of the moment of publication, it is a process rather than a product. It is always open to change and therefore never quite finished. 
	- "\[This] leads to a social edition, where input comes from within the team and from outside. Contributions are made by external institutions such as libraries and archives, but some editions also try to attract and activate the communities of the scholarly or even wider interested public. (30)
	- The digital edition shows a strong tendency toward multiple texts, rather than the one-text paradigm. There may be a diplomatic version and a reading text. 
- He wraps up with the question, what is the difference between an edition and a project? There is the constant issue of grand visions to create editions on high levels of methodology but these visions fizzling out and remaining as mere drafts and prototypes. He insists you must "State your rules and follow them!" (36). 
- His four concluding questions: 
	1. Is there a full representation of the subject in question? This may be an edited text or at least a very accurate transcription. Sometimes, although this is rather an exception than the rule and depends on the specific characteristics of the material, a digital facsimile may suffice. Sometimes even a structured database can be a complete representation.
	2. Is it critical? Have rules for the processing of the material been stated and substantiated? Have these rules been applied in the light of the relevant scholarly knowledge on the material, its genesis, its contexts and its reception? Does the edition add information to the representation making it more accessible, understandable and usable?  
	3. Is the edition of academic quality? Have the rules been applied rigorously and in a transparent manner? Are the responsibilities stated clearly? Does the edition suffice as a substitute for the previous editions or primary documents making it unnecessary to go back to them in most cases? Does it enable further scholarly research on a reliable and trustworthy basis?  
	4. Does the edition follow a digital paradigm? Does it make use of the possibilities of digital technology and media? Is it not printable without a major loss of content and functionality?
