## NOTES ON: "The Cultural Construction of Reading in Anglo-Saxon England", by Nicholas Howe
in Liuzza, Old English Literature: Critical Essays

* "The sense of reading as a communal act... may be taken as a useful model for considering readings as a performative event in Anglo-Saxon England." (2)
* "This sense of wonder belongs, then, to a man [Augustine], who believed that the way to truth was through the written word as performed or interpreted within a community." (3)
* "That such a community would produce discordant babble rather than interpretive dialogue holds only if we assume that it had no protocols for reading." (3)
* ræd - giving counsel through speech
* "What conditions led speakers of Old English to conceive of comprehending a written text in ways that had not to do with gathering, but rather with offering counsel or solving a riddle?" (6)
* "In an oral culture, to give counsel is of necessity to speak and thereby to create community." (7)
* Look for Bloomfield "Understanding Old English Poetry" in _Annuale Mediaevale_ 9 (1968) [[bloomfield_understanding-oe-poetry]]
* "In this encounter, Cædmon becomes a Christian hero by turning traditional poetics to the new and urgent purpose of propagating the faith. In doing so, he seems to preserve a necessary place for orality in a culture where religious authority was increasingly defined by those who could read the written text of the Latin Bible." (12)
