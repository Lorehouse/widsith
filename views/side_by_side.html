            <h2>Widsith</h2>
			<h3>Modern English</h3>
            <p>
				Widsið spoke, unlocked his wordhoard,<br/>
				he who most of all people over the earth<br/>
				traveled among tribes; often in great halls he received<br/>
				handsome gifts. He came from the people<br/>
				of the Myrgings. He with Ealhhilde, <br/>
				the fair peace-weaver, first traveled<br/>
				seeking the home of the king of the Ostrogoths,<br/>
				Ermanric, east of the Angle's land,<br/>
				hostile oathbreaker. He began then to speak a great many words:<br/>
				"I have learned by asking many men who rule tribes!<br/>
				Men shall each live in good custom,<br/>
				a leader after others, governing their homeland,<br/>
				whoever desires his throne to prosper.<br/>
				There was Hwala, for a while the best,<br/>
				and Alexander (the Great) most powerful<br/>
				of all mankind, and he most throve<br/>
				Of those whom I have heard of over the earth.<br/>
				Atilla ruled the Huns, Ermanric the Goths,<br/>
				Becca the Banings, Gifica the Burgundians.<br/>
				Caesar ruled the Greeks and Caelic the Finns,<br/>
				Hagena the Rugians, and Heoden the Glomman.<br/>
				Witta ruled the Swaefe, Wada Haelsings,<br/>
				Meaca Myrgings, Mearchealf the Hundings (same as the Langobards).<br/>
				Theodric ruled the Franks, Thyle the Rondings,<br/>
				Breoca the Brondings, Billing the Werns.<br/>
				Oswin ruled the Eows and Fin the Jutes,<br/>
				Fin Folkwalding the Frisian tribes.<br/>
				Sighere ruled the Sea-Danes the longest,<br/>
				Hnaef the Hocings, Helm the Wulfings,<br/>
				Wald the Woings, Wod the Thuringians,<br/>
				Saeferth the Sycgans, Ongendtheow the Swedes,<br/>
				Sceafthere the Ymbran, Sheaf the Langobards,<br/>
				Hunn the Haetwere, and Holen the Wrosnan.<br/>
				Hringwald was called the Herefaren's king.<br/>
				Offa ruled the Angel, Alewih the Danes:<br/>
				He was of those men the noblest,<br/>
				however he did not achieve more valorous deeds than Offa,<br/>
				but Offa won first of men, <br/>
				while a youth, the greatest kingdom.<br/>
				Not any of his contemporaries were greater in valorous deeds<br/>
				at fighting. With his one sword <br/>
				he defined the boundary against the Myrgings<br/>
				by Fifeldore (the Eider estuary), held afterwards<br/>
				by the Angels and the Suebi as he'd won it.<br/>
				Hrothwulf and Hrothgar held longest <br/>
				kinship together, uncle and sister's son,<br/>
				after they drove off the Viking trible<br/>
				and humbled Ingeld's vanguard,<br/>
				and at Heorot cut to pieces the force of the Heathobards.<br/>
				As I traversed many foreign lands<br/>
				throughout a wide region, good and evil<br/>
				I experienced there, deprived of my people,<br/>
				far from generous kinsmen, and served far and wide. <br/>
				Therefore I will sing and speak a tale, <br/>
				Making known before the company in the mead-hall<br/>
				how the well-born would be generous with choice gifts to me.<br/>
				I was with the Huns and with the Ostrogoths,<br/>
				with the Swedes and with the Geats and with the South-Danes.<br/>
				With the Wenlas I was, and with the Varn, and with the Vikings.<br/>
				With the Gibids I was and with the Winedas and with the Gefflegans.<br/>
				With the Angles I was and with the Swaefe and with the Aenenas.<br/>
				With the Saxons I was and the Sycgans and with the Suardones.<br/>
				With the Hronan I was and the Deans and with the Heathoramas.<br/>
				With the Thuringians I was and with the Throwend <br/>
				and with the Burgundians; There I received a necklace;<br/>
				there Guthhere gave a goodly treasure <br/>
				to reward songs; that king was not stingy!<br/>
				With the Franks I was and with the Frisians and with the Framtings.<br/>
				With the Rugians I was and with the Glomman and with the Rome-foreigners.<br/>
				Likewise I was in Italy with Aelfwine<br/>
				who had of all mankind whom I have learned <br/>
				the quickest hand to earning praise, <br/>
				a generous heart distributing rings<br/>
				bright treasures, that son of Edwin!<br/>
				With the Sercings I was and with the Serae.<br/>
				With the Greeks I was and with the Finns and with Caesar,<br/>
				he who ruled over many towns of revelry, <br/>
				possessed riches and treasures and the realm of the Romans.<br/>
				With the Irish I was and with the Picts and with the Lapps.<br/>
				With the Lidwiccas I was and with the Leonas and with the Langobards,<br/>
				With heathens and with heroes and with the Hundings (could heathens and heroes be puns?).<br/>
				with the Israelites I was and with the Assyrians, <br/>
				with the Hebrews and with the Indus and with the Egyptians.<br/>
				WIth the Moids I was and with the Perse, and with the Myrgings<br/>
				and the Mofdings and the Ongendmyrgings<br/>
				and with the Amothings. With the east Thuringians I was<br/>
				and with the Ilwan and with the Austrogoths and Idumings. <br/>
				And I was with Ermanric all the time,<br/>
				There the king of the Goths was good and generous to me,<br/>
				first among the townspeople, gave me a ring<br/>
				in which of refined gold, the count of <br/>
				six hundred shillings were reckoned,<br/>
				Which I gave into the possession of Eadgils,<br/>
				my lord protector, when I came home,<br/>
				to my beloved lord because it was he who gave me land,<br/>
				the king of the Myrgings, my father's inheritance.<br/>
				And then to me Ealhhild gave a second ring, <br/>
				the queen of the army fighting men, the daughter of Edwin. <br/>
				Her praise stretched throughout many lands<br/>
				when I in song must say<br/>
				where under the sky I best knew<br/>
				the gold-adorned queen distributing gifts.<br/>
				Then with Scilling our clear voices<br/>
				we raised before our victory lord<br/>
				loudly with harp, singing loud to the harp<br/>
				then many men of proud spirits<br/>
				who had good knowledge spoke words<br/>
				that they had never heard a better song.<br/>
				Thence I traversed all the land of the Ostrogoths, <br/>
				I sought the best battle comrades<br/>
				that was ever the household of Ermanric.<br/>
				Hache I sought and Beadecan and the Herelingas<br/>
				Emerca I sought and Fridla and the East-goths,<br/>
				wise and good, father of Unwen<br/>
				Seccan I sought and Beccan, Seafola and Theodric<br/>
				Heathoric and Sifecta, Lotherus and Incgentheow.<br/>
				Edwin I sought and Elsa, Agelmund and Hungar,<br/>
				and the proud company of the Withmyrgings.<br/>
				Wulfhere I sought and Wyrmhere, very often warfare was not at rest<br/>
				when the Hraede army with hard swords<br/>
				around the Wistle wood must defend<br/>
				the ancestral lands of Attila's people.<br/>
				Raedhere I sought and Rondhere, Rumstan and Gislaharius,<br/>
				Withergield and Freotheric, Wudga and Hama<br/>
				there were not the worst comrades in arms<br/>
				Though I mention them at the last.<br/>
				Very often from that company flew the whining<br/>
				and shrieking spear against a hostile people.<br/>
				Wanderers there ruled with wound gold<br/>
				over men and women, Wudga and Hama.<br/>
				Thus I have always found it in journeying<br/>
				that they be dearest to their subjects<br/>
				whom God has given the right to rule men<br/>
				for holding while he lives here.<br/>
				Thus are fated to wandering and roving<br/>
				are the minstrel men throughout many regions,<br/>
				saying at need, speaking thank-words,<br/>
				always meeting someone south or north<br/>
				appreciative of poems with generous gifts for those<br/>
				who before military men will will heighten their reputation<br/>
				to do valorous deeds until everything passes,<br/>
				light and life together. He who works for praise <br/>
				has under the heavens lasting glory.<br/>
