	<ul>
		<li><span class="named-entity">Myrgingas</span>: the tribe to which Widsið belonged. 'By virtue of the Offa episode, the Myrgings can be localized with some precision; they lived south of the river Eider, in a region apparently identical with that held by the Saxons of Ptolemy and certainly identical with that held by the Nordalbings of later times, themselves a branch of the Old Saxons (to use King Alfred's term).' (Malone 183). The Myrgings were likely a Saxonish tribe called the Maurungani of the Geographer of Ravenna.</li>
